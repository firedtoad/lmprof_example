Book 01	Genesis

001:001 In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.

001:002 And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was
        upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon
        the face of the waters.

001:003 And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.

001:004 And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the
        light from the darkness.

001:005 And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called
        Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.

001:006 And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the
        waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.

001:007 And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were
        under the firmament from the waters which were above the
        firmament: and it was so.

001:008 And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the
        morning were the second day.

001:009 And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered
        together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it
        was so.

001:010 And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together
        of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.

001:011 And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb
        yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his
        kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.

001:012 And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed
        after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in
        itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.

001:013 And the evening and the morning were the third day.

001:014 And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the
        heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for
        signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:

001:015 And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to
        give light upon the earth: and it was so.

001:016 And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the
        day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars
        also.

001:017 And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light
        upon the earth,

001:018 And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the
        light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.

001:019 And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.

001:020 And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving
        creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth
        in the open firmament of heaven.

001:021 And God created great whales, and every living creature that
        moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their
        kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that
        it was good.

001:022 And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and
        fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the
        earth.

001:023 And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.

001:024 And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature
        after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the
        earth after his kind: and it was so.

001:025 And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle
        after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth
        after his kind: and God saw that it was good.

001:026 And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our
        likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea,
        and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over
        all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth
        upon the earth.

001:027 So God created man in his own image, in the image of God
        created he him; male and female created he them.

001:028 And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and
        multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have
        dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the
        air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.

001:029 And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing
        seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree,
        in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it
        shall be for meat.

001:030 And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air,
        and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there
        is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was
        so.

001:031 And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was
        very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.

002:001 Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host
        of them.

002:002 And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made;
        and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he
        had made.

002:003 And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because
        that in it he had rested from all his work which God created
        and made.

002:004 These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when
        they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth
        and the heavens,

002:005 And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and
        every herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had
        not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man
        to till the ground.

002:006 But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole
        face of the ground.

002:007 And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and
        breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became
        a living soul.

002:008 And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there
        he put the man whom he had formed.

002:009 And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree
        that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of
        life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of
        knowledge of good and evil.

002:010 And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from
        thence it was parted, and became into four heads.

002:011 The name of the first is Pison: that is it which compasseth
        the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;

002:012 And the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the
        onyx stone.

002:013 And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that
        compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia.

002:014 And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which
        goeth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is
        Euphrates.

002:015 And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of
        Eden to dress it and to keep it.

002:016 And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of
        the garden thou mayest freely eat:

002:017 But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt
        not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou
        shalt surely die.

002:018 And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be
        alone; I will make him an help meet for him.

002:019 And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the
        field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam
        to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called
        every living creature, that was the name thereof.

002:020 And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air,
        and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not
        found an help meet for him.

002:021 And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he
        slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh
        instead thereof;

002:022 And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a
        woman, and brought her unto the man.

002:023 And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my
        flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of
        Man.

002:024 Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and
        shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.

002:025 And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not
        ashamed.

003:001 Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field
        which the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea,
        hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?

003:002 And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit
        of the trees of the garden:

003:003 But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the
        garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall
        ye touch it, lest ye die.

003:004 And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:

003:005 For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your
        eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good
        and evil.

003:006 And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and
        that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to
        make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and
        gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.

003:007 And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they
        were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made
        themselves aprons.

003:008 And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden
        in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves
        from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the
        garden.

003:009 And the LORD God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where
        art thou?

003:010 And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was
        afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.

003:011 And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou
        eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou
        shouldest not eat?

003:012 And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me,
        she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.

003:013 And the LORD God said unto the woman, What is this that thou
        hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I
        did eat.

003:014 And the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done
        this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast
        of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt
        thou eat all the days of thy life:

003:015 And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between
        thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou
        shalt bruise his heel.

003:016 Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and
        thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and
        thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over
        thee.

003:017 And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the
        voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I
        commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is
        the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all
        the days of thy life;

003:018 Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and
        thou shalt eat the herb of the field;

003:019 In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou
        return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for
        dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.

003:020 And Adam called his wife's name Eve; because she was the
        mother of all living.

003:021 Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of
        skins, and clothed them.

003:022 And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us,
        to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand,
        and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:

003:023 Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden,
        to till the ground from whence he was taken.

003:024 So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the
        garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned
        every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.

004:001 And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain,
        and said, I have gotten a man from the LORD.

004:002 And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of
        sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.

004:003 And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of
        the fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD.

004:004 And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and
        of the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to
        his offering:

004:005 But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain
        was very wroth, and his countenance fell.

004:006 And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is
        thy countenance fallen?

004:007 If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou
        doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee shall be
        his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.

004:008 And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass,
        when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel
        his brother, and slew him.

004:009 And the LORD said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he
        said, I know not: Am I my brother's keeper?

004:010 And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's
        blood crieth unto me from the ground.

004:011 And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her
        mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand;

004:012 When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield
        unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou
        be in the earth.

004:013 And Cain said unto the LORD, My punishment is greater than I
        can bear.

004:014 Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the
        earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a
        fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to
        pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me.

004:015 And the LORD said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain,
        vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the LORD set a
        mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him.

004:016 And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in
        the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.

004:017 And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and
        he builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the
        name of his son, Enoch.

004:018 And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and
        Mehujael begat Methusael: and Methusael begat Lamech.

004:019 And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was
        Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.

004:020 And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in
        tents, and of such as have cattle.

004:021 And his brother's name was Jubal: he was the father of all
        such as handle the harp and organ.

004:022 And Zillah, she also bare Tubalcain, an instructer of every
        artificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubalcain was
        Naamah.

004:023 And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my
        voice; ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: for I have
        slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt.

004:024 If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and
        sevenfold.

004:025 And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called
        his name Seth: For God, said she, hath appointed me another
        seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew.

004:026 And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called
        his name Enos: then began men to call upon the name of the
        LORD.

005:001 This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that
        God created man, in the likeness of God made he him;

005:002 Male and female created he them; and blessed them, and called
        their name Adam, in the day when they were created.

005:003 And Adam lived an hundred and thirty years, and begat a son in
        his own likeness, and after his image; and called his name
        Seth:

005:004 And the days of Adam after he had begotten Seth were eight
        hundred years: and he begat sons and daughters:

005:005 And all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty
        years: and he died.

005:006 And Seth lived an hundred and five years, and begat Enos:

005:007 And Seth lived after he begat Enos eight hundred and seven
        years, and begat sons and daughters:

005:008 And all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years:
        and he died.

005:009 And Enos lived ninety years, and begat Cainan:

005:010 And Enos lived after he begat Cainan eight hundred and fifteen
        years, and begat sons and daughters:

005:011 And all the days of Enos were nine hundred and five years: and
        he died.

005:012 And Cainan lived seventy years and begat Mahalaleel:

005:013 And Cainan lived after he begat Mahalaleel eight hundred and
        forty years, and begat sons and daughters:

005:014 And all the days of Cainan were nine hundred and ten years:
        and he died.

005:015 And Mahalaleel lived sixty and five years, and begat Jared:

005:016 And Mahalaleel lived after he begat Jared eight hundred and
        thirty years, and begat sons and daughters:

005:017 And all the days of Mahalaleel were eight hundred ninety and
        five years: and he died.

005:018 And Jared lived an hundred sixty and two years, and he begat
        Enoch:

005:019 And Jared lived after he begat Enoch eight hundred years, and
        begat sons and daughters:

005:020 And all the days of Jared were nine hundred sixty and two
        years: and he died.

005:021 And Enoch lived sixty and five years, and begat Methuselah:

005:022 And Enoch walked with God after he begat Methuselah three
        hundred years, and begat sons and daughters:

005:023 And all the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty and five
        years:

005:024 And Enoch walked with God: and he was not; for God took him.

005:025 And Methuselah lived an hundred eighty and seven years, and
        begat Lamech.

005:026 And Methuselah lived after he begat Lamech seven hundred
        eighty and two years, and begat sons and daughters:

005:027 And all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred sixty and
        nine years: and he died.

005:028 And Lamech lived an hundred eighty and two years, and begat a
        son:

005:029 And he called his name Noah, saying, This same shall comfort
        us concerning our work and toil of our hands, because of the
        ground which the LORD hath cursed.

005:030 And Lamech lived after he begat Noah five hundred ninety and
        five years, and begat sons and daughters:

005:031 And all the days of Lamech were seven hundred seventy and
        seven years: and he died.

005:032 And Noah was five hundred years old: and Noah begat Shem, Ham,
        and Japheth.

006:001 And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of
        the earth, and daughters were born unto them,

006:002 That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were
        fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.

006:003 And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man,
        for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred
        and twenty years.

006:004 There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after
        that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men,
        and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men
        which were of old, men of renown.

006:005 And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth,
        and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was
        only evil continually.

006:006 And it repented the LORD that he had made man on the earth,
        and it grieved him at his heart.

006:007 And the LORD said, I will destroy man whom I have created from
        the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping
        thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I
        have made them.

006:008 But Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORD.

006:009 These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and
        perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God.

006:010 And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.

006:011 The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was
        filled with violence.

006:012 And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt;
        for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.

006:013 And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before
        me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and,
        behold, I will destroy them with the earth.

006:014 Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the
        ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.

006:015 And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The
        length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth
        of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.

006:016 A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou
        finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the
        side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou
        make it.

006:017 And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the
        earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life,
        from under heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall
        die.

006:018 But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt
        come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy
        sons' wives with thee.

006:019 And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort
        shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee;
        they shall be male and female.

006:020 Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of
        every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every
        sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive.

006:021 And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou
        shalt gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee,
        and for them.

006:022 Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did
        he.

007:001 And the LORD said unto Noah, Come thou and all thy house into
        the ark; for thee have I seen righteous before me in this
        generation.

007:002 Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the
        male and his female: and of beasts that are not clean by two,
        the male and his female.

007:003 Of fowls also of the air by sevens, the male and the female;
        to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth.

007:004 For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth
        forty days and forty nights; and every living substance that I
        have made will I destroy from off the face of the earth.

007:005 And Noah did according unto all that the LORD commanded him.

007:006 And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters
        was upon the earth.

007:007 And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons'
        wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the
        flood.

007:008 Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of
        fowls, and of every thing that creepeth upon the earth,

007:009 There went in two and two unto Noah into the ark, the male and
        the female, as God had commanded Noah.

007:010 And it came to pass after seven days, that the waters of the
        flood were upon the earth.

007:011 In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month,
        the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the
        fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of
        heaven were opened.

007:012 And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights.

007:013 In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and
        Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three
        wives of his sons with them, into the ark;

007:014 They, and every beast after his kind, and all the cattle after
        their kind, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the
        earth after his kind, and every fowl after his kind, every
        bird of every sort.

007:015 And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all
        flesh, wherein is the breath of life.

007:016 And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh,
        as God had commanded him: and the LORD shut him in.

007:017 And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters
        increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the
        earth.

007:018 And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the
        earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters.

007:019 And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all
        the high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were
        covered.

007:020 Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the
        mountains were covered.

007:021 And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl,
        and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that
        creepeth upon the earth, and every man:

007:022 All in whose nostrils was the breath of life, of all that was
        in the dry land, died.

007:023 And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the
        face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping
        things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed
        from the earth: and Noah only remained alive, and they that
        were with him in the ark.

007:024 And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty
        days.

008:001 And God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the
        cattle that was with him in the ark: and God made a wind to
        pass over the earth, and the waters asswaged;

008:002 The fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were
        stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained;

008:003 And the waters returned from off the earth continually: and
        after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were
        abated.

008:004 And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth
        day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat.

008:005 And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in
        the tenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops
        of the mountains seen.

008:006 And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened
        the window of the ark which he had made:

008:007 And he sent forth a raven, which went forth to and fro, until
        the waters were dried up from off the earth.

008:008 Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were
        abated from off the face of the ground;

008:009 But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she
        returned unto him into the ark, for the waters were on the
        face of the whole earth: then he put forth his hand, and took
        her, and pulled her in unto him into the ark.

008:010 And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth
        the dove out of the ark;

008:011 And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her
        mouth was an olive leaf pluckt off: so Noah knew that the
        waters were abated from off the earth.

008:012 And he stayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove;
        which returned not again unto him any more.

008:013 And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in
        the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were
        dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of
        the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was
        dry.

008:014 And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the
        month, was the earth dried.

008:015 And God spake unto Noah, saying,

008:016 Go forth of the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy
        sons' wives with thee.

008:017 Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of
        all flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping
        thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed
        abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon
        the earth.

008:018 And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons'
        wives with him:

008:019 Every beast, every creeping thing, and every fowl, and
        whatsoever creepeth upon the earth, after their kinds, went
        forth out of the ark.

008:020 And Noah builded an altar unto the LORD; and took of every
        clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt
        offerings on the altar.

008:021 And the LORD smelled a sweet savour; and the LORD said in his
        heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man's
        sake; for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his
        youth; neither will I again smite any more every thing living,
        as I have done.

008:022 While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and
        heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not
        cease.

009:001 And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be
        fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.

009:002 And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every
        beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all
        that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the
        sea; into your hand are they delivered.

009:003 Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as
        the green herb have I given you all things.

009:004 But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof,
        shall ye not eat.

009:005 And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the
        hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man;
        at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of
        man.

009:006 Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed:
        for in the image of God made he man.

009:007 And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly
        in the earth, and multiply therein.

009:008 And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying,

009:009 And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your
        seed after you;

009:010 And with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl,
        of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from
        all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth.

009:011 And I will establish my covenant with you, neither shall all
        flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither
        shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.

009:012 And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make
        between me and you and every living creature that is with you,
        for perpetual generations:

009:013 I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a
        covenant between me and the earth.

009:014 And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the
        earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud:

009:015 And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you
        and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall
        no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.

009:016 And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it,
        that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and
        every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.

009:017 And God said unto Noah, This is the token of the covenant,
        which I have established between me and all flesh that is upon
        the earth.

009:018 And the sons of Noah, that went forth of the ark, were Shem,
        and Ham, and Japheth: and Ham is the father of Canaan.

009:019 These are the three sons of Noah: and of them was the whole
        earth overspread.

009:020 And Noah began to be an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard:

009:021 And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was
        uncovered within his tent.

009:022 And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his
        father, and told his two brethren without.

009:023 And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both
        their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness
        of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw
        not their father's nakedness.

009:024 And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son
        had done unto him.

009:025 And he said, Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he
        be unto his brethren.

009:026 And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Shem; and Canaan shall
        be his servant.

009:027 God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of
        Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.

009:028 And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.

009:029 And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years:
        and he died.

010:001 Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham,
        and Japheth: and unto them were sons born after the flood.

010:002 The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan,
        and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras.

010:003 And the sons of Gomer; Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah.

010:004 And the sons of Javan; Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and
        Dodanim.

010:005 By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their
        lands; every one after his tongue, after their families, in
        their nations.

010:006 And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan.

010:007 And the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and
        Raamah, and Sabtechah: and the sons of Raamah; Sheba, and
        Dedan.

010:008 And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the
        earth.

010:009 He was a mighty hunter before the LORD: wherefore it is said,
        Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the LORD.

010:010 And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and
        Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.

010:011 Out of that land went forth Asshur, and builded Nineveh, and
        the city Rehoboth, and Calah,

010:012 And Resen between Nineveh and Calah: the same is a great city.

010:013 And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and
        Naphtuhim,

010:014 And Pathrusim, and Casluhim, (out of whom came Philistim,) and
        Caphtorim.

010:015 And Canaan begat Sidon his first born, and Heth,

010:016 And the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgasite,

010:017 And the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite,

010:018 And the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite: and
        afterward were the families of the Canaanites spread abroad.

010:019 And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou
        comest to Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goest, unto Sodom, and
        Gomorrah, and Admah, and Zeboim, even unto Lasha.

010:020 These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their
        tongues, in their countries, and in their nations.

010:021 Unto Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, the
        brother of Japheth the elder, even to him were children born.

010:022 The children of Shem; Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud,
        and Aram.

010:023 And the children of Aram; Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash.

010:024 And Arphaxad begat Salah; and Salah begat Eber.

010:025 And unto Eber were born two sons: the name of one was Peleg;
        for in his days was the earth divided; and his brother's name
        was Joktan.

010:026 And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and
        Jerah,

010:027 And Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah,

010:028 And Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba,

010:029 And Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: all these were the sons of
        Joktan.

010:030 And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest unto Sephar a
        mount of the east.

010:031 These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their
        tongues, in their lands, after their nations.

010:032 These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their
        generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations
        divided in the earth after the flood.

011:001 And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech.

011:002 And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that
        they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt
        there.

011:003 And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and
        burn them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime
        had they for morter.

011:004 And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower,
        whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name,
        lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.

011:005 And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which
        the children of men builded.

011:006 And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one, and they have
        all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing
        will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do.

011:007 Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that
        they may not understand one another's speech.

011:008 So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of
        all the earth: and they left off to build the city.

011:009 Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the LORD did
        there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence
        did the LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the
        earth.

011:010 These are the generations of Shem: Shem was an hundred years
        old, and begat Arphaxad two years after the flood:

011:011 And Shem lived after he begat Arphaxad five hundred years, and
        begat sons and daughters.

011:012 And Arphaxad lived five and thirty years, and begat Salah:

011:013 And Arphaxad lived after he begat Salah four hundred and three
        years, and begat sons and daughters.

011:014 And Salah lived thirty years, and begat Eber:

011:015 And Salah lived after he begat Eber four hundred and three
        years, and begat sons and daughters.

011:016 And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg:

011:017 And Eber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty
        years, and begat sons and daughters.

011:018 And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu:

011:019 And Peleg lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years,
        and begat sons and daughters.

011:020 And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug:

011:021 And Reu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven
        years, and begat sons and daughters.

011:022 And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor:

011:023 And Serug lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years, and
        begat sons and daughters.

011:024 And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah:

011:025 And Nahor lived after he begat Terah an hundred and nineteen
        years, and begat sons and daughters.

011:026 And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and
        Haran.

011:027 Now these are the generations of Terah: Terah begat Abram,
        Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begat Lot.

011:028 And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his
        nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees.

011:029 And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram's wife
        was Sarai; and the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, the daughter
        of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah.

011:030 But Sarai was barren; she had no child.

011:031 And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his
        son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's
        wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees,
        to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and
        dwelt there.

011:032 And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and
        Terah died in Haran.

012:001 Now the LORD had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country,
        and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land
        that I will shew thee:

012:002 And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee,
        and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:

012:003 And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that
        curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be
        blessed.

012:004 So Abram departed, as the LORD had spoken unto him; and Lot
        went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when
        he departed out of Haran.

012:005 And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and
        all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that
        they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the
        land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.

012:006 And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Sichem,
        unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the
        land.

012:007 And the LORD appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will
        I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the LORD,
        who appeared unto him.

012:008 And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of
        Bethel, and pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and
        Hai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the LORD,
        and called upon the name of the LORD.

012:009 And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south.

012:010 And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into
        Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the
        land.

012:011 And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into
        Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know
        that thou art a fair woman to look upon:

012:012 Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see
        thee, that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will
        kill me, but they will save thee alive.

012:013 Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with
        me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.

012:014 And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the
        Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.

012:015 The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before
        Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.

012:016 And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep,
        and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and
        she asses, and camels.

012:017 And the LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues
        because of Sarai Abram's wife.

012:018 And Pharaoh called Abram and said, What is this that thou hast
        done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy
        wife?

012:019 Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her
        to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go
        thy way.

012:020 And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent
        him away, and his wife, and all that he had.

013:001 And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that
        he had, and Lot with him, into the south.

013:002 And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold.

013:003 And he went on his journeys from the south even to Bethel,
        unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning,
        between Bethel and Hai;

013:004 Unto the place of the altar, which he had make there at the
        first: and there Abram called on the name of the LORD.

013:005 And Lot also, which went with Abram, had flocks, and herds,
        and tents.

013:006 And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell
        together: for their substance was great, so that they could
        not dwell together.

013:007 And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram's cattle
        and the herdmen of Lot's cattle: and the Canaanite and the
        Perizzite dwelled then in the land.

013:008 And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee,
        between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen;
        for we be brethren.

013:009 Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray
        thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go
        to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will
        go to the left.

013:010 And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of
        Jordan, that it was well watered every where, before the LORD
        destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, even as the garden of the LORD,
        like the land of Egypt, as thou comest unto Zoar.

013:011 Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed
        east: and they separated themselves the one from the other.

013:012 Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the
        cities of the plain, and pitched his tent toward Sodom.

013:013 But the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the LORD
        exceedingly.

013:014 And the LORD said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated
        from him, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place
        where thou art northward, and southward, and eastward, and
        westward:

013:015 For all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and
        to thy seed for ever.

013:016 And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if
        a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed
        also be numbered.

013:017 Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the
        breadth of it; for I will give it unto thee.

013:018 Then Abram removed his tent, and came and dwelt in the plain
        of Mamre, which is in Hebron, and built there an altar unto
        the LORD.

014:001 And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar,
        Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal
        king of nations;

014:002 That these made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha
        king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of
        Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar.

014:003 All these were joined together in the vale of Siddim, which is
        the salt sea.

014:004 Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth
        year they rebelled.

014:005 And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings
        that were with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth
        Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emins in Shaveh
        Kiriathaim,

014:006 And the Horites in their mount Seir, unto Elparan, which is by
        the wilderness.

014:007 And they returned, and came to Enmishpat, which is Kadesh, and
        smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the
        Amorites, that dwelt in Hazezontamar.

014:008 And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of
        Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and
        the king of Bela (the same is Zoar;) and they joined battle
        with them in the vale of Siddim;

014:009 With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of
        nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of
        Ellasar; four kings with five.

014:010 And the vale of Siddim was full of slimepits; and the kings of
        Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that
        remained fled to the mountain.

014:011 And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all
        their victuals, and went their way.

014:012 And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom,
        and his goods, and departed.

014:013 And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the
        Hebrew; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite,
        brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and these were
        confederate with Abram.

014:014 And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he
        armed his trained servants, born in his own house, three
        hundred and eighteen, and pursued them unto Dan.

014:015 And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by
        night, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is
        on the left hand of Damascus.

014:016 And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his
        brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the
        people.

014:017 And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return
        from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that were
        with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which is the king's dale.

014:018 And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine:
        and he was the priest of the most high God.

014:019 And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most
        high God, possessor of heaven and earth:

014:020 And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine
        enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all.

014:021 And the king of Sodom said unto Abram, Give me the persons,
        and take the goods to thyself.

014:022 And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand
        unto the LORD, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and
        earth,

014:023 That I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and
        that I will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou
        shouldest say, I have made Abram rich:

014:024 Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion
        of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let
        them take their portion.

015:001 After these things the word of the LORD came unto Abram in a
        vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy
        exceeding great reward.

015:002 And Abram said, LORD God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go
        childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of
        Damascus?

015:003 And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and,
        lo, one born in my house is mine heir.

015:004 And, behold, the word of the LORD came unto him, saying, This
        shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of
        thine own bowels shall be thine heir.

015:005 And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward
        heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them:
        and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be.

015:006 And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for
        righteousness.

015:007 And he said unto him, I am the LORD that brought thee out of
        Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it.

015:008 And he said, LORD God, whereby shall I know that I shall
        inherit it?

015:009 And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old,
        and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years
        old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.

015:010 And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst,
        and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided
        he not.

015:011 And when the fowls came down upon the carcases, Abram drove
        them away.

015:012 And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram;
        and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.

015:013 And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall
        be a stranger in a land that is not their's, and shall serve
        them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;

015:014 And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and
        afterward shall they come out with great substance.

015:015 And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be
        buried in a good old age.

015:016 But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for
        the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.

015:017 And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was
        dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed
        between those pieces.

015:018 In the same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying,
        Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt
        unto the great river, the river Euphrates:

015:019 The Kenites, and the Kenizzites, and the Kadmonites,

015:020 And the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Rephaims,

015:021 And the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Girgashites, and
        the Jebusites.

016:001 Now Sarai Abram's wife bare him no children: and she had an
        handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar.

016:002 And Sarai said unto Abram, Behold now, the LORD hath
        restrained me from bearing: I pray thee, go in unto my maid;
        it may be that I may obtain children by her. And Abram
        hearkened to the voice of Sarai.

016:003 And Sarai Abram's wife took Hagar her maid the Egyptian, after
        Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her
        to her husband Abram to be his wife.

016:004 And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw
        that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.

016:005 And Sarai said unto Abram, My wrong be upon thee: I have given
        my maid into thy bosom; and when she saw that she had
        conceived, I was despised in her eyes: the LORD judge between
        me and thee.

016:006 But Abram said unto Sarai, Behold, thy maid is in thine hand;
        do to her as it pleaseth thee. And when Sarai dealt hardly
        with her, she fled from her face.

016:007 And the angel of the LORD found her by a fountain of water in
        the wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur.

016:008 And he said, Hagar, Sarai's maid, whence camest thou? and
        whither wilt thou go? And she said, I flee from the face of my
        mistress Sarai.

016:009 And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Return to thy
        mistress, and submit thyself under her hands.

016:010 And the angel of the LORD said unto her, I will multiply thy
        seed exceedingly, that it shall not be numbered for multitude.

016:011 And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Behold, thou art with
        child and shalt bear a son, and shalt call his name Ishmael;
        because the LORD hath heard thy affliction.

016:012 And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man,
        and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the
        presence of all his brethren.

016:013 And she called the name of the LORD that spake unto her, Thou
        God seest me: for she said, Have I also here looked after him
        that seeth me?

016:014 Wherefore the well was called Beerlahairoi; behold, it is
        between Kadesh and Bered.

016:015 And Hagar bare Abram a son: and Abram called his son's name,
        which Hagar bare, Ishmael.

016:016 And Abram was fourscore and six years old, when Hagar bare
        Ishmael to Abram.

017:001 And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the LORD
        appeared to Abram, and said unto him, I am the Almighty God;
        walk before me, and be thou perfect.

017:002 And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will
        multiply thee exceedingly.

017:003 And Abram fell on his face: and God talked with him, saying,

017:004 As for me, behold, my covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be
        a father of many nations.

017:005 Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name
        shall be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made
        thee.

017:006 And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make
        nations of thee, and kings shall come out of thee.

017:007 And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy
        seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting
        covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.

017:008 And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the
        land wherein thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for
        an everlasting possession; and I will be their God.

017:009 And God said unto Abraham, Thou shalt keep my covenant
        therefore, thou, and thy seed after thee in their generations.

017:010 This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you
        and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be
        circumcised.

017:011 And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and it
        shall be a token of the covenant betwixt me and you.

017:012 And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you,
        every man child in your generations, he that is born in the
        house, or bought with money of any stranger, which is not of
        thy seed.

017:013 He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy
        money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in
        your flesh for an everlasting covenant.

017:014 And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is
        not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people;
        he hath broken my covenant.

017:015 And God said unto Abraham, As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt
        not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall her name be.

017:016 And I will bless her, and give thee a son also of her: yea, I
        will bless her, and she shall be a mother of nations; kings of
        people shall be of her.

017:017 Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his
        heart, Shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years
        old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?

017:018 And Abraham said unto God, O that Ishmael might live before
        thee!

017:019 And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and
        thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my
        covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, and with his
        seed after him.

017:020 And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed
        him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him
        exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make
        him a great nation.

017:021 But my covenant will I establish with Isaac, which Sarah shall
        bear unto thee at this set time in the next year.

017:022 And he left off talking with him, and God went up from
        Abraham.

017:023 And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in
        his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male
        among the men of Abraham's house; and circumcised the flesh of
        their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had said unto him.

017:024 And Abraham was ninety years old and nine, when he was
        circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.

017:025 And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old, when he was
        circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.

017:026 In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his
        son.

017:027 And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought
        with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him.

018:001 And the LORD appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre: and he
        sat in the tent door in the heat of the day;

018:002 And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood
        by him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the
        tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,

018:003 And said, My LORD, if now I have found favour in thy sight,
        pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant:

018:004 Let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your
        feet, and rest yourselves under the tree:

018:005 And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your
        hearts; after that ye shall pass on: for therefore are ye come
        to your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said.

018:006 And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make
        ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make
        cakes upon the hearth.

018:007 And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetcht a calf tender and
        good, and gave it unto a young man; and he hasted to dress it.

018:008 And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had
        dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under
        the tree, and they did eat.

018:009 And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said,
        Behold, in the tent.

018:010 And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to
        the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son.
        And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him.

018:011 Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age; and
        it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.

018:012 Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am
        waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?

018:013 And the LORD said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh,
        saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, which am old?

018:014 Is any thing too hard for the LORD? At the time appointed I
        will return unto thee, according to the time of life, and
        Sarah shall have a son.

018:015 Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid.
        And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.

018:016 And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and
        Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.

018:017 And the LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which
        I do;

018:018 Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty
        nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in
        him?

018:019 For I know him, that he will command his children and his
        household after him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD,
        to do justice and judgment; that the LORD may bring upon
        Abraham that which he hath spoken of him.

018:020 And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is
        great, and because their sin is very grievous;

018:021 I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether
        according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not,
        I will know.

018:022 And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward
        Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the LORD.

018:023 And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the
        righteous with the wicked?

018:024 Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt
        thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty
        righteous that are therein?

018:025 That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the
        righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as
        the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all
        the earth do right?

018:026 And the LORD said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within
        the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes.

018:027 And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon
        me to speak unto the LORD, which am but dust and ashes:

018:028 Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous:
        wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said,
        If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy it.

018:029 And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there
        shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for
        forty's sake.

018:030 And he said unto him, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will
        speak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he
        said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there.

018:031 And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto
        the LORD: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And
        he said, I will not destroy it for twenty's sake.

018:032 And he said, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will speak
        yet but this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And
        he said, I will not destroy it for ten's sake.

018:033 And the LORD went his way, as soon as he had left communing
        with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place.

019:001 And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the
        gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and
        he bowed himself with his face toward the ground;

019:002 And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into
        your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet,
        and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they
        said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.

019:003 And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him,
        and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did
        bake unleavened bread, and they did eat.

019:004 But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of
        Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the
        people from every quarter:

019:005 And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men
        which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that
        we may know them.

019:006 And Lot went out at the door unto them, and shut the door
        after him,

019:007 And said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly.

019:008 Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let
        me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as
        is good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for
        therefore came they under the shadow of my roof.

019:009 And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one
        fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now
        will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed
        sore upon the man, even Lot, and came near to break the door.

019:010 But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the
        house to them, and shut to the door.

019:011 And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with
        blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied
        themselves to find the door.

019:012 And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in
        law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast
        in the city, bring them out of this place:

019:013 For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is
        waxen great before the face of the LORD; and the LORD hath
        sent us to destroy it.

019:014 And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which
        married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this
        place; for the LORD will destroy this city. But he seemed as
        one that mocked unto his sons in law.

019:015 And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot,
        saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are
        here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.

019:016 And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and
        upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two
        daughters; the LORD being merciful unto him: and they brought
        him forth, and set him without the city.

019:017 And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad,
        that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee,
        neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain,
        lest thou be consumed.

019:018 And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my LORD:

019:019 Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and
        thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me
        in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest
        some evil take me, and I die:

019:020 Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little
        one: Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and
        my soul shall live.

019:021 And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning
        this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the
        which thou hast spoken.

019:022 Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do anything till thou
        be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called
        Zoar.

019:023 The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar.

019:024 Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone
        and fire from the LORD out of heaven;

019:025 And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the
        inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the
        ground.

019:026 But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a
        pillar of salt.

019:027 And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he
        stood before the LORD:

019:028 And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the
        land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the
        country went up as the smoke of a furnace.

019:029 And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the
        plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the
        midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the
        which Lot dwelt.

019:030 And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and
        his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar:
        and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.

019:031 And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old,
        and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after
        the manner of all the earth:

019:032 Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with
        him, that we may preserve seed of our father.

019:033 And they made their father drink wine that night: and the
        firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived
        not when she lay down, nor when she arose.

019:034 And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said
        unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father:
        let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in,
        and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.

019:035 And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the
        younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she
        lay down, nor when she arose.

019:036 Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their
        father.

019:037 And the first born bare a son, and called his name Moab: the
        same is the father of the Moabites unto this day.

019:038 And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name
        Benammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto
        this day.

020:001 And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country,
        and dwelled between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar.

020:002 And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister: and
        Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah.

020:003 But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to
        him, Behold, thou art but a dead man, for the woman which thou
        hast taken; for she is a man's wife.

020:004 But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, LORD, wilt
        thou slay also a righteous nation?

020:005 Said he not unto me, She is my sister? and she, even she
        herself said, He is my brother: in the integrity of my heart
        and innocency of my hands have I done this.

020:006 And God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst
        this in the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee
        from sinning against me: therefore suffered I thee not to
        touch her.

020:007 Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet,
        and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou
        restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou,
        and all that are thine.

020:008 Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all
        his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the
        men were sore afraid.

020:009 Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast
        thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou
        hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast
        done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.

020:010 And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou
        hast done this thing?

020:011 And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God is
        not in this place; and they will slay me for my wife's sake.

020:012 And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my
        father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my
        wife.

020:013 And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my
        father's house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness
        which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall
        come, say of me, He is my brother.

020:014 And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and
        womenservants, and gave them unto Abraham, and restored him
        Sarah his wife.

020:015 And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before thee: dwell
        where it pleaseth thee.

020:016 And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a
        thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a covering of
        the eyes, unto all that are with thee, and with all other:
        thus she was reproved.

020:017 So Abraham prayed unto God: and God healed Abimelech, and his
        wife, and his maidservants; and they bare children.

020:018 For the LORD had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of
        Abimelech, because of Sarah Abraham's wife.

021:001 And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did
        unto Sarah as he had spoken.

021:002 For Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at
        the set time of which God had spoken to him.

021:003 And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him,
        whom Sarah bare to him, Isaac.

021:004 And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being eight days old, as
        God had commanded him.

021:005 And Abraham was an hundred years old, when his son Isaac was
        born unto him.

021:006 And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh, so that all that
        hear will laugh with me.

021:007 And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah
        should have given children suck? for I have born him a son in
        his old age.

021:008 And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great
        feast the same day that Isaac was weaned.

021:009 And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had
        born unto Abraham, mocking.

021:010 Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and
        her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with
        my son, even with Isaac.

021:011 And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight because of
        his son.

021:012 And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight
        because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that
        Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in
        Isaac shall thy seed be called.

021:013 And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation,
        because he is thy seed.

021:014 And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and
        a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her
        shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed,
        and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba.

021:015 And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child
        under one of the shrubs.

021:016 And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way
        off, as it were a bow shot: for she said, Let me not see the
        death of the child. And she sat over against him, and lift up
        her voice, and wept.

021:017 And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God
        called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth
        thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad
        where he is.

021:018 Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will
        make him a great nation.

021:019 And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she
        went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad
        drink.

021:020 And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the
        wilderness, and became an archer.

021:021 And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took
        him a wife out of the land of Egypt.

021:022 And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol
        the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God
        is with thee in all that thou doest:

021:023 Now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not
        deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son's son:
        but according to the kindness that I have done unto thee, thou
        shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned.

021:024 And Abraham said, I will swear.

021:025 And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water,
        which Abimelech's servants had violently taken away.

021:026 And Abimelech said, I wot not who hath done this thing;
        neither didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I of it, but to
        day.

021:027 And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech;
        and both of them made a covenant.

021:028 And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.

021:029 And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What mean these seven ewe
        lambs which thou hast set by themselves?

021:030 And he said, For these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my
        hand, that they may be a witness unto me, that I have digged
        this well.

021:031 Wherefore he called that place Beersheba; because there they
        sware both of them.

021:032 Thus they made a covenant at Beersheba: then Abimelech rose
        up, and Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they
        returned into the land of the Philistines.

021:033 And Abraham planted a grove in Beersheba, and called there on
        the name of the LORD, the everlasting God.

021:034 And Abraham sojourned in the Philistines' land many days.

022:001 And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt
        Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here
        I am.

022:002 And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou
        lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him
        there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I
        will tell thee of.

022:003 And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass,
        and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and
        clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went
        unto the place of which God had told him.

022:004 Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the
        place afar off.

022:005 And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the
        ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come
        again to you.

022:006 And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it
        upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a
        knife; and they went both of them together.

022:007 And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father:
        and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire
        and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?

022:008 And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for
        a burnt offering: so they went both of them together.

022:009 And they came to the place which God had told him of; and
        Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and
        bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.

022:010 And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to
        slay his son.

022:011 And the angel of the LORD called unto him out of heaven, and
        said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I.

022:012 And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou
        any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God,
        seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me.

022:013 And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind
        him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went
        and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in
        the stead of his son.

022:014 And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovahjireh: as it
        is said to this day, In the mount of the LORD it shall be
        seen.

022:015 And the angel of the LORD called unto Abraham out of heaven
        the second time,

022:016 And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the LORD, for because
        thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son,
        thine only son:

022:017 That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will
        multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand
        which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the
        gate of his enemies;

022:018 And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed;
        because thou hast obeyed my voice.

022:019 So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and
        went together to Beersheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beersheba.

022:020 And it came to pass after these things, that it was told
        Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children
        unto thy brother Nahor;

022:021 Huz his firstborn, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father
        of Aram,

022:022 And Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel.

022:023 And Bethuel begat Rebekah: these eight Milcah did bear to
        Nahor, Abraham's brother.

022:024 And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tebah,
        and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah.

023:001 And Sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old: these
        were the years of the life of Sarah.

023:002 And Sarah died in Kirjatharba; the same is Hebron in the land
        of Canaan: and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep
        for her.

023:003 And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spake unto the
        sons of Heth, saying,

023:004 I am a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession
        of a buryingplace with you, that I may bury my dead out of my
        sight.

023:005 And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him,

023:006 Hear us, my lord: thou art a mighty prince among us: in the
        choice of our sepulchres bury thy dead; none of us shall
        withhold from thee his sepulchre, but that thou mayest bury
        thy dead.

023:007 And Abraham stood up, and bowed himself to the people of the
        land, even to the children of Heth.

023:008 And he communed with them, saying, If it be your mind that I
        should bury my dead out of my sight; hear me, and intreat for
        me to Ephron the son of Zohar,

023:009 That he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he hath,
        which is in the end of his field; for as much money as it is
        worth he shall give it me for a possession of a buryingplace
        amongst you.

023:010 And Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth: and Ephron the
        Hittite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of
        Heth, even of all that went in at the gate of his city,
        saying,

023:011 Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave
        that is therein, I give it thee; in the presence of the sons
        of my people give I it thee: bury thy dead.

023:012 And Abraham bowed down himself before the people of the land.

023:013 And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the
        land, saying, But if thou wilt give it, I pray thee, hear me:
        I will give thee money for the field; take it of me, and I
        will bury my dead there.

023:014 And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him,

023:015 My lord, hearken unto me: the land is worth four hundred
        shekels of silver; what is that betwixt me and thee? bury
        therefore thy dead.

023:016 And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to
        Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the
        sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money
        with the merchant.

023:017 And the field of Ephron which was in Machpelah, which was
        before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and
        all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the
        borders round about, were made sure

023:018 Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children
        of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city.

023:019 And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of
        the field of Machpelah before Mamre: the same is Hebron in the
        land of Canaan.

023:020 And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure
        unto Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of
        Heth.

024:001 And Abraham was old, and well stricken in age: and the LORD
        had blessed Abraham in all things.

024:002 And Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house, that
        ruled over all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under
        my thigh:

024:003 And I will make thee swear by the LORD, the God of heaven, and
        the God of the earth, that thou shalt not take a wife unto my
        son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell:

024:004 But thou shalt go unto my country, and to my kindred, and take
        a wife unto my son Isaac.

024:005 And the servant said unto him, Peradventure the woman will not
        be willing to follow me unto this land: must I needs bring thy
        son again unto the land from whence thou camest?

024:006 And Abraham said unto him, Beware thou that thou bring not my
        son thither again.

024:007 The LORD God of heaven, which took me from my father's house,
        and from the land of my kindred, and which spake unto me, and
        that sware unto me, saying, Unto thy seed will I give this
        land; he shall send his angel before thee, and thou shalt take
        a wife unto my son from thence.

024:008 And if the woman will not be willing to follow thee, then thou
        shalt be clear from this my oath: only bring not my son
        thither again.

024:009 And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his
        master, and sware to him concerning that matter.

024:010 And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master,
        and departed; for all the goods of his master were in his
        hand: and he arose, and went to Mesopotamia, unto the city of
        Nahor.

024:011 And he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a
        well of water at the time of the evening, even the time that
        women go out to draw water.

024:012 And he said O LORD God of my master Abraham, I pray thee, send
        me good speed this day, and shew kindness unto my master
        Abraham.

024:013 Behold, I stand here by the well of water; and the daughters
        of the men of the city come out to draw water:

024:014 And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say,
        Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she
        shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: let
        the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant
        Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed kindness
        unto my master.

024:015 And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that,
        behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel, son of
        Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother, with her pitcher
        upon her shoulder.

024:016 And the damsel was very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither
        had any man known her: and she went down to the well, and
        filled her pitcher, and came up.

024:017 And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me, I pray
        thee, drink a little water of thy pitcher.

024:018 And she said, Drink, my lord: and she hasted, and let down her
        pitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink.

024:019 And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will draw
        water for thy camels also, until they have done drinking.

024:020 And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and
        ran again unto the well to draw water, and drew for all his
        camels.

024:021 And the man wondering at her held his peace, to wit whether
        the LORD had made his journey prosperous or not.

024:022 And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that the
        man took a golden earring of half a shekel weight, and two
        bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold;

024:023 And said, Whose daughter art thou? tell me, I pray thee: is
        there room in thy father's house for us to lodge in?

024:024 And she said unto him, I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of
        Milcah, which she bare unto Nahor.

024:025 She said moreover unto him, We have both straw and provender
        enough, and room to lodge in.

024:026 And the man bowed down his head, and worshipped the LORD.

024:027 And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of my master Abraham, who
        hath not left destitute my master of his mercy and his truth:
        I being in the way, the LORD led me to the house of my
        master's brethren.

024:028 And the damsel ran, and told them of her mother's house these
        things.

024:029 And Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban: and Laban
        ran out unto the man, unto the well.

024:030 And it came to pass, when he saw the earring and bracelets
        upon his sister's hands, and when he heard the words of
        Rebekah his sister, saying, Thus spake the man unto me; that
        he came unto the man; and, behold, he stood by the camels at
        the well.

024:031 And he said, Come in, thou blessed of the LORD; wherefore
        standest thou without? for I have prepared the house, and room
        for the camels.

024:032 And the man came into the house: and he ungirded his camels,
        and gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash
        his feet, and the men's feet that were with him.

024:033 And there was set meat before him to eat: but he said, I will
        not eat, until I have told mine errand. And he said, Speak on.

024:034 And he said, I am Abraham's servant.

024:035 And the LORD hath blessed my master greatly; and he is become
        great: and he hath given him flocks, and herds, and silver,
        and gold, and menservants, and maidservants, and camels, and
        asses.

024:036 And Sarah my master's wife bare a son to my master when she
        was old: and unto him hath he given all that he hath.

024:037 And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a
        wife to my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose
        land I dwell:

024:038 But thou shalt go unto my father's house, and to my kindred,
        and take a wife unto my son.

024:039 And I said unto my master, Peradventure the woman will not
        follow me.

024:040 And he said unto me, The LORD, before whom I walk, will send
        his angel with thee, and prosper thy way; and thou shalt take
        a wife for my son of my kindred, and of my father's house:

024:041 Then shalt thou be clear from this my oath, when thou comest
        to my kindred; and if they give not thee one, thou shalt be
        clear from my oath.

024:042 And I came this day unto the well, and said, O LORD God of my
        master Abraham, if now thou do prosper my way which I go:

024:043 Behold, I stand by the well of water; and it shall come to
        pass, that when the virgin cometh forth to draw water, and I
        say to her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water of thy
        pitcher to drink;

024:044 And she say to me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for
        thy camels: let the same be the woman whom the LORD hath
        appointed out for my master's son.

024:045 And before I had done speaking in mine heart, behold, Rebekah
        came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down
        unto the well, and drew water: and I said unto her, Let me
        drink, I pray thee.

024:046 And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her
        shoulder, and said, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink
        also: so I drank, and she made the camels drink also.

024:047 And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter art thou? And she
        said, the daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bare
        unto him: and I put the earring upon her face, and the
        bracelets upon her hands.

024:048 And I bowed down my head, and worshipped the LORD, and blessed
        the LORD God of my master Abraham, which had led me in the
        right way to take my master's brother's daughter unto his son.

024:049 And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell
        me: and if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right hand, or
        to the left.

024:050 Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceedeth
        from the LORD: we cannot speak unto thee bad or good.

024:051 Behold, Rebekah is before thee, take her, and go, and let her
        be thy master's son's wife, as the LORD hath spoken.

024:052 And it came to pass, that, when Abraham's servant heard their
        words, he worshipped the LORD, bowing himself to the earth.

024:053 And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of
        gold, and raiment, and gave them to Rebekah: he gave also to
        her brother and to her mother precious things.

024:054 And they did eat and drink, he and the men that were with him,
        and tarried all night; and they rose up in the morning, and he
        said, Send me away unto my master.

024:055 And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with
        us a few days, at the least ten; after that she shall go.

024:056 And he said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing the LORD hath
        prospered my way; send me away that I may go to my master.

024:057 And they said, We will call the damsel, and enquire at her
        mouth.

024:058 And they called Rebekah, and said unto her, Wilt thou go with
        this man? And she said, I will go.

024:059 And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and
        Abraham's servant, and his men.

024:060 And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, Thou art our
        sister, be thou the mother of thousands of millions, and let
        thy seed possess the gate of those which hate them.

024:061 And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the
        camels, and followed the man: and the servant took Rebekah,
        and went his way.

024:062 And Isaac came from the way of the well Lahairoi; for he dwelt
        in the south country.

024:063 And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide:
        and he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, the camels
        were coming.

024:064 And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she
        lighted off the camel.

024:065 For she had said unto the servant, What man is this that
        walketh in the field to meet us? And the servant had said, It
        is my master: therefore she took a vail, and covered herself.

024:066 And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done.

024:067 And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent, and took
        Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her: and Isaac
        was comforted after his mother's death.

025:001 Then again Abraham took a wife, and her name was Keturah.

025:002 And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian,
        and Ishbak, and Shuah.

025:003 And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were
        Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim.

025:004 And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and
        Abidah, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah.

025:005 And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac.

025:006 But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had,
        Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son,
        while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country.

025:007 And these are the days of the years of Abraham's life which he
        lived, an hundred threescore and fifteen years.

025:008 Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an
        old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people.

025:009 And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of
        Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the
        Hittite, which is before Mamre;

025:010 The field which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth: there
        was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife.

025:011 And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God
        blessed his son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahairoi.

025:012 Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom
        Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bare unto Abraham:

025:013 And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their
        names, according to their generations: the firstborn of
        Ishmael, Nebajoth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,

025:014 And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,

025:015 Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah:

025:016 These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by
        their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to
        their nations.

025:017 And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and
        thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and
        was gathered unto his people.

025:018 And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that is before Egypt,
        as thou goest toward Assyria: and he died in the presence of
        all his brethren.

025:019 And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son: Abraham
        begat Isaac:

025:020 And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife,
        the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padanaram, the sister to
        Laban the Syrian.

025:021 And Isaac intreated the LORD for his wife, because she was
        barren: and the LORD was intreated of him, and Rebekah his
        wife conceived.

025:022 And the children struggled together within her; and she said,
        If it be so, why am I thus? And she went to enquire of the
        LORD.

025:023 And the LORD said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, and
        two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels; and
        the one people shall be stronger than the other people; and
        the elder shall serve the younger.

025:024 And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold,
        there were twins in her womb.

025:025 And the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment;
        and they called his name Esau.

025:026 And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on
        Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was
        threescore years old when she bare them.

025:027 And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the
        field; and Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents.

025:028 And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison: but
        Rebekah loved Jacob.

025:029 And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he
        was faint:

025:030 And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same
        red pottage; for I am faint: therefore was his name called
        Edom.

025:031 And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright.

025:032 And Esau said, Behold, I am at the point to die: and what
        profit shall this birthright do to me?

025:033 And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he sware unto him:
        and he sold his birthright unto Jacob.

025:034 Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did
        eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau
        despised his birthright.

026:001 And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine
        that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech
        king of the Philistines unto Gerar.

026:002 And the LORD appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into
        Egypt; dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of:

026:003 Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless
        thee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these
        countries, and I will perform the oath which I sware unto
        Abraham thy father;

026:004 And I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven,
        and will give unto thy seed all these countries; and in thy
        seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed;

026:005 Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my
        commandments, my statutes, and my laws.

026:006 And Isaac dwelt in Gerar:

026:007 And the men of the place asked him of his wife; and he said,
        She is my sister: for he feared to say, She is my wife; lest,
        said he, the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah;
        because she was fair to look upon.

026:008 And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that
        Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and
        saw, and, behold, Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife.

026:009 And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she
        is thy wife; and how saidst thou, She is my sister? And Isaac
        said unto him, Because I said, Lest I die for her.

026:010 And Abimelech said, What is this thou hast done unto us? one
        of the people might lightly have lien with thy wife, and thou
        shouldest have brought guiltiness upon us.

026:011 And Abimelech charged all his people, saying, He that toucheth
        this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.

026:012 Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year
        an hundredfold: and the LORD blessed him.

026:013 And the man waxed great, and went forward, and grew until he
        became very great:

026:014 For he had possession of flocks, and possession of herds, and
        great store of servants: and the Philistines envied him.

026:015 For all the wells which his father's servants had digged in
        the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped
        them, and filled them with earth.

026:016 And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us; for thou art much
        mightier than we.

026:017 And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley
        of Gerar, and dwelt there.

026:018 And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had
        digged in the days of Abraham his father; for the Philistines
        had stopped them after the death of Abraham: and he called
        their names after the names by which his father had called
        them.

026:019 And Isaac's servants digged in the valley, and found there a
        well of springing water.

026:020 And the herdmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac's herdmen,
        saying, The water is ours: and he called the name of the well
        Esek; because they strove with him.

026:021 And they digged another well, and strove for that also: and he
        called the name of it Sitnah.

026:022 And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for
        that they strove not: and he called the name of it Rehoboth;
        and he said, For now the LORD hath made room for us, and we
        shall be fruitful in the land.

026:023 And he went up from thence to Beersheba.

026:024 And the LORD appeared unto him the same night, and said, I am
        the God of Abraham thy father: fear not, for I am with thee,
        and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant
        Abraham's sake.

026:025 And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of the
        LORD, and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac's servants
        digged a well.

026:026 Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his
        friends, and Phichol the chief captain of his army.

026:027 And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore come ye to me, seeing ye
        hate me, and have sent me away from you?

026:028 And they said, We saw certainly that the LORD was with thee:
        and we said, Let there be now an oath betwixt us, even betwixt
        us and thee, and let us make a covenant with thee;

026:029 That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and
        as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have sent thee
        away in peace: thou art now the blessed of the LORD.

026:030 And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink.

026:031 And they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one to
        another: and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him
        in peace.

026:032 And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac's servants came,
        and told him concerning the well which they had digged, and
        said unto him, We have found water.

026:033 And he called it Shebah: therefore the name of the city is
        Beersheba unto this day.

026:034 And Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith the
        daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of
        Elon the Hittite:

026:035 Which were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah.

027:001 And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes
        were dim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his eldest
        son, and said unto him, My son: and he said unto him, Behold,
        here am I.

027:002 And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my
        death:

027:003 Now therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver and
        thy bow, and go out to the field, and take me some venison;

027:004 And make me savoury meat, such as I love, and bring it to me,
        that I may eat; that my soul may bless thee before I die.

027:005 And Rebekah heard when Isaac spake to Esau his son. And Esau
        went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it.

027:006 And Rebekah spake unto Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard
        thy father speak unto Esau thy brother, saying,

027:007 Bring me venison, and make me savoury meat, that I may eat,
        and bless thee before the LORD before my death.

027:008 Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I
        command thee.

027:009 Go now to the flock, and fetch me from thence two good kids of
        the goats; and I will make them savoury meat for thy father,
        such as he loveth:

027:010 And thou shalt bring it to thy father, that he may eat, and
        that he may bless thee before his death.

027:011 And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother
        is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man:

027:012 My father peradventure will feel me, and I shall seem to him
        as a deceiver; and I shall bring a curse upon me, and not a
        blessing.

027:013 And his mother said unto him, Upon me be thy curse, my son:
        only obey my voice, and go fetch me them.

027:014 And he went, and fetched, and brought them to his mother: and
        his mother made savoury meat, such as his father loved.

027:015 And Rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son Esau, which
        were with her in the house, and put them upon Jacob her
        younger son:

027:016 And she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands,
        and upon the smooth of his neck:

027:017 And she gave the savoury meat and the bread, which she had
        prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.

027:018 And he came unto his father, and said, My father: and he said,
        Here am I; who art thou, my son?

027:019 And Jacob said unto his father, I am Esau thy first born; I
        have done according as thou badest me: arise, I pray thee, sit
        and eat of my venison, that thy soul may bless me.

027:020 And Isaac said unto his son, How is it that thou hast found it
        so quickly, my son? And he said, Because the LORD thy God
        brought it to me.

027:021 And Isaac said unto Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I may
        feel thee, my son, whether thou be my very son Esau or not.

027:022 And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father; and he felt him,
        and said, The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the
        hands of Esau.

027:023 And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his
        brother Esau's hands: so he blessed him.

027:024 And he said, Art thou my very son Esau? And he said, I am.

027:025 And he said, Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son's
        venison, that my soul may bless thee. And he brought it near
        to him, and he did eat: and he brought him wine and he drank.

027:026 And his father Isaac said unto him, Come near now, and kiss
        me, my son.

027:027 And he came near, and kissed him: and he smelled the smell of
        his raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my
        son is as the smell of a field which the LORD hath blessed:

027:028 Therefore God give thee of the dew of heaven, and the fatness
        of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine:

027:029 Let people serve thee, and nations bow down to thee: be lord
        over thy brethren, and let thy mother's sons bow down to thee:
        cursed be every one that curseth thee, and blessed be he that
        blesseth thee.

027:030 And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of
        blessing Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the
        presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in
        from his hunting.

027:031 And he also had made savoury meat, and brought it unto his
        father, and said unto his father, Let my father arise, and eat
        of his son's venison, that thy soul may bless me.

027:032 And Isaac his father said unto him, Who art thou? And he said,
        I am thy son, thy firstborn Esau.

027:033 And Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who? where is
        he that hath taken venison, and brought it me, and I have
        eaten of all before thou camest, and have blessed him? yea,
        and he shall be blessed.

027:034 And when Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with a
        great and exceeding bitter cry, and said unto his father,
        Bless me, even me also, O my father.

027:035 And he said, Thy brother came with subtilty, and hath taken
        away thy blessing.

027:036 And he said, Is not he rightly named Jacob? for he hath
        supplanted me these two times: he took away my birthright;
        and, behold, now he hath taken away my blessing. And he said,
        Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me?

027:037 And Isaac answered and said unto Esau, Behold, I have made him
        thy lord, and all his brethren have I given to him for
        servants; and with corn and wine have I sustained him: and
        what shall I do now unto thee, my son?

027:038 And Esau said unto his father, Hast thou but one blessing, my
        father? bless me, even me also, O my father. And Esau lifted
        up his voice, and wept.

027:039 And Isaac his father answered and said unto him, Behold, thy
        dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of
        heaven from above;

027:040 And by thy sword shalt thou live, and shalt serve thy brother;
        and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion,
        that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck.

027:041 And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith his
        father blessed him: and Esau said in his heart, The days of
        mourning for my father are at hand; then will I slay my
        brother Jacob.

027:042 And these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah:
        and she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said unto
        him, Behold, thy brother Esau, as touching thee, doth comfort
        himself, purposing to kill thee.

027:043 Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; arise, flee thou to
        Laban my brother to Haran;

027:044 And tarry with him a few days, until thy brother's fury turn
        away;

027:045 Until thy brother's anger turn away from thee, and he forget
        that which thou hast done to him: then I will send, and fetch
        thee from thence: why should I be deprived also of you both in
        one day?

027:046 And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life because of
        the daughters of Heth: if Jacob take a wife of the daughters
        of Heth, such as these which are of the daughters of the land,
        what good shall my life do me?

028:001 And Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and charged him, and
        said unto him, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of
        Canaan.

028:002 Arise, go to Padanaram, to the house of Bethuel thy mother's
        father; and take thee a wife from thence of the daughers of
        Laban thy mother's brother.

028:003 And God Almighty bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and
        multiply thee, that thou mayest be a multitude of people;

028:004 And give thee the blessing of Abraham, to thee, and to thy
        seed with thee; that thou mayest inherit the land wherein thou
        art a stranger, which God gave unto Abraham.

028:005 And Isaac sent away Jacob: and he went to Padanaram unto
        Laban, son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah,
        Jacob's and Esau's mother.

028:006 When Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob, and sent him away
        to Padanaram, to take him a wife from thence; and that as he
        blessed him he gave him a charge, saying, Thou shalt not take
        a wife of the daughers of Canaan;

028:007 And that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother, and was gone
        to Padanaram;

028:008 And Esau seeing that the daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac
        his father;

028:009 Then went Esau unto Ishmael, and took unto the wives which he
        had Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abraham's son, the sister
        of Nebajoth, to be his wife.

028:010 And Jacob went out from Beersheba, and went toward Haran.

028:011 And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all
        night, because the sun was set; and he took of the stones of
        that place, and put them for his pillows, and lay down in that
        place to sleep.

028:012 And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and
        the top of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God
        ascending and descending on it.

028:013 And, behold, the LORD stood above it, and said, I am the LORD
        God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: the land
        whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed;

028:014 And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt
        spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north,
        and to the south: and in thee and in thy seed shall all the
        families of the earth be blessed.

028:015 And, behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places
        whither thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land;
        for I will not leave thee, until I have done that which I have
        spoken to thee of.

028:016 And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the
        LORD is in this place; and I knew it not.

028:017 And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! this
        is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of
        heaven.

028:018 And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone
        that he had put for his pillows, and set it up for a pillar,
        and poured oil upon the top of it.

028:019 And he called the name of that place Bethel: but the name of
        that city was called Luz at the first.

028:020 And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and
        will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to
        eat, and raiment to put on,

028:021 So that I come again to my father's house in peace; then shall
        the LORD be my God:

028:022 And this stone, which I have set for a pillar, shall be God's
        house: and of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give
        the tenth unto thee.

029:001 Then Jacob went on his journey, and came into the land of the
        people of the east.

029:002 And he looked, and behold a well in the field, and, lo, there
        were three flocks of sheep lying by it; for out of that well
        they watered the flocks: and a great stone was upon the well's
        mouth.

029:003 And thither were all the flocks gathered: and they rolled the
        stone from the well's mouth, and watered the sheep, and put
        the stone again upon the well's mouth in his place.

029:004 And Jacob said unto them, My brethren, whence be ye? And they
        said, Of Haran are we.

029:005 And he said unto them, Know ye Laban the son of Nahor? And
        they said, We know him.

029:006 And he said unto them, Is he well? And they said, He is well:
        and, behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep.

029:007 And he said, Lo, it is yet high day, neither is it time that
        the cattle should be gathered together: water ye the sheep,
        and go and feed them.

029:008 And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered
        together, and till they roll the stone from the well's mouth;
        then we water the sheep.

029:009 And while he yet spake with them, Rachel came with her
        father's sheep; for she kept them.

029:010 And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of
        Laban his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his
        mother's brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone
        from the well's mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his
        mother's brother.

029:011 And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept.

029:012 And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's brother, and
        that he was Rebekah's son: and she ran and told her father.

029:013 And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his
        sister's son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and
        kissed him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban
        all these things.

029:014 And Laban said to him, Surely thou art my bone and my flesh.
        And he abode with him the space of a month.

029:015 And Laban said unto Jacob, Because thou art my brother,
        shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought? tell me, what
        shall thy wages be?

029:016 And Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder was Leah,
        and the name of the younger was Rachel.

029:017 Leah was tender eyed; but Rachel was beautiful and well
        favoured.

029:018 And Jacob loved Rachel; and said, I will serve thee seven
        years for Rachel thy younger daughter.

029:019 And Laban said, It is better that I give her to thee, than
        that I should give her to another man: abide with me.

029:020 And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed unto
        him but a few days, for the love he had to her.

029:021 And Jacob said unto Laban, Give me my wife, for my days are
        fulfilled, that I may go in unto her.

029:022 And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made
        a feast.

029:023 And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his
        daughter, and brought her to him; and he went in unto her.

029:024 And Laban gave unto his daughter Leah Zilpah his maid for an
        handmaid.

029:025 And it came to pass, that in the morning, behold, it was Leah:
        and he said to Laban, What is this thou hast done unto me? did
        not I serve with thee for Rachel? wherefore then hast thou
        beguiled me?

029:026 And Laban said, It must not be so done in our country, to give
        the younger before the firstborn.

029:027 Fulfil her week, and we will give thee this also for the
        service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years.

029:028 And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week: and he gave him
        Rachel his daughter to wife also.

029:029 And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to
        be her maid.

029:030 And he went in also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more
        than Leah, and served with him yet seven other years.

029:031 And when the LORD saw that Leah was hated, he opened her womb:
        but Rachel was barren.

029:032 And Leah conceived, and bare a son, and she called his name
        Reuben: for she said, Surely the LORD hath looked upon my
        affliction; now therefore my husband will love me.

029:033 And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Because the
        LORD hath heard I was hated, he hath therefore given me this
        son also: and she called his name Simeon.

029:034 And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Now this
        time will my husband be joined unto me, because I have born
        him three sons: therefore was his name called Levi.

029:035 And she conceived again, and bare a son: and she said, Now
        will I praise the LORD: therefore she called his name Judah;
        and left bearing.

030:001 And when Rachel saw that she bare Jacob no children, Rachel
        envied her sister; and said unto Jacob, Give me children, or
        else I die.

030:002 And Jacob's anger was kindled against Rachel: and he said, Am
        I in God's stead, who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the
        womb?

030:003 And she said, Behold my maid Bilhah, go in unto her; and she
        shall bear upon my knees, that I may also have children by
        her.

030:004 And she gave him Bilhah her handmaid to wife: and Jacob went
        in unto her.

030:005 And Bilhah conceived, and bare Jacob a son.

030:006 And Rachel said, God hath judged me, and hath also heard my
        voice, and hath given me a son: therefore called she his name
        Dan.

030:007 And Bilhah Rachel's maid conceived again, and bare Jacob a
        second son.

030:008 And Rachel said, With great wrestlings have I wrestled with my
        sister, and I have prevailed: and she called his name
        Naphtali.

030:009 When Leah saw that she had left bearing, she took Zilpah her
        maid, and gave her Jacob to wife.

030:010 And Zilpah Leah's maid bare Jacob a son.

030:011 And Leah said, A troop cometh: and she called his name Gad.

030:012 And Zilpah Leah's maid bare Jacob a second son.

030:013 And Leah said, Happy am I, for the daughters will call me
        blessed: and she called his name Asher.

030:014 And Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found
        mandrakes in the field, and brought them unto his mother Leah.
        Then Rachel said to Leah, Give me, I pray thee, of thy son's
        mandrakes.

030:015 And she said unto her, Is it a small matter that thou hast
        taken my husband? and wouldest thou take away my son's
        mandrakes also? And Rachel said, Therefore he shall lie with
        thee to night for thy son's mandrakes.

030:016 And Jacob came out of the field in the evening, and Leah went
        out to meet him, and said, Thou must come in unto me; for
        surely I have hired thee with my son's mandrakes. And he lay
        with her that night.

030:017 And God hearkened unto Leah, and she conceived, and bare Jacob
        the fifth son.

030:018 And Leah said, God hath given me my hire, because I have given
        my maiden to my husband: and she called his name Issachar.

030:019 And Leah conceived again, and bare Jacob the sixth son.

030:020 And Leah said, God hath endued me with a good dowry; now will
        my husband dwell with me, because I have born him six sons:
        and she called his name Zebulun.

030:021 And afterwards she bare a daughter, and called her name Dinah.

030:022 And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, and
        opened her womb.

030:023 And she conceived, and bare a son; and said, God hath taken
        away my reproach:

030:024 And she called his name Joseph; and said, The LORD shall add
        to me another son.

030:025 And it came to pass, when Rachel had born Joseph, that Jacob
        said unto Laban, Send me away, that I may go unto mine own
        place, and to my country.

030:026 Give me my wives and my children, for whom I have served thee,
        and let me go: for thou knowest my service which I have done
        thee.

030:027 And Laban said unto him, I pray thee, if I have found favour
        in thine eyes, tarry: for I have learned by experience that
        the LORD hath blessed me for thy sake.

030:028 And he said, Appoint me thy wages, and I will give it.

030:029 And he said unto him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and
        how thy cattle was with me.

030:030 For it was little which thou hadst before I came, and it is
        now increased unto a multitude; and the LORD hath blessed thee
        since my coming: and now when shall I provide for mine own
        house also?

030:031 And he said, What shall I give thee? And Jacob said, Thou
        shalt not give me any thing: if thou wilt do this thing for
        me, I will again feed and keep thy flock.

030:032 I will pass through all thy flock to day, removing from thence
        all the speckled and spotted cattle, and all the brown cattle
        among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats:
        and of such shall be my hire.

030:033 So shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come, when
        it shall come for my hire before thy face: every one that is
        not speckled and spotted among the goats, and brown among the
        sheep, that shall be counted stolen with me.

030:034 And Laban said, Behold, I would it might be according to thy
        word.

030:035 And he removed that day the he goats that were ringstraked and
        spotted, and all the she goats that were speckled and spotted,
        and every one that had some white in it, and all the brown
        among the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons.

030:036 And he set three days' journey betwixt himself and Jacob: and
        Jacob fed the rest of Laban's flocks.

030:037 And Jacob took him rods of green poplar, and of the hazel and
        chesnut tree; and pilled white strakes in them, and made the
        white appear which was in the rods.

030:038 And he set the rods which he had pilled before the flocks in
        the gutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to
        drink, that they should conceive when they came to drink.

030:039 And the flocks conceived before the rods, and brought forth
        cattle ringstraked, speckled, and spotted.

030:040 And Jacob did separate the lambs, and set the faces of the
        flocks toward the ringstraked, and all the brown in the flock
        of Laban; and he put his own flocks by themselves, and put
        them not unto Laban's cattle.

030:041 And it came to pass, whensoever the stronger cattle did
        conceive, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the
        cattle in the gutters, that they might conceive among the
        rods.

030:042 But when the cattle were feeble, he put them not in: so the
        feebler were Laban's, and the stronger Jacob's.

030:043 And the man increased exceedingly, and had much cattle, and
        maidservants, and menservants, and camels, and asses.

031:001 And he heard the words of Laban's sons, saying, Jacob hath
        taken away all that was our father's; and of that which was
        our father's hath he gotten all this glory.

031:002 And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it was
        not toward him as before.

031:003 And the LORD said unto Jacob, Return unto the land of thy
        fathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee.

031:004 And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto
        his flock,

031:005 And said unto them, I see your father's countenance, that it
        is not toward me as before; but the God of my father hath been
        with me.

031:006 And ye know that with all my power I have served your father.

031:007 And your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten
        times; but God suffered him not to hurt me.

031:008 If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages; then all the
        cattle bare speckled: and if he said thus, The ringstraked
        shall be thy hire; then bare all the cattle ringstraked.

031:009 Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father, and given
        them to me.

031:010 And it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived,
        that I lifted up mine eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold,
        the rams which leaped upon the cattle were ringstraked,
        speckled, and grisled.

031:011 And the angel of God spake unto me in a dream, saying, Jacob:
        And I said, Here am I.

031:012 And he said, Lift up now thine eyes, and see, all the rams
        which leap upon the cattle are ringstraked, speckled, and
        grisled: for I have seen all that Laban doeth unto thee.

031:013 I am the God of Bethel, where thou anointedst the pillar, and
        where thou vowedst a vow unto me: now arise, get thee out from
        this land, and return unto the land of thy kindred.

031:014 And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him, Is there yet
        any portion or inheritance for us in our father's house?

031:015 Are we not counted of him strangers? for he hath sold us, and
        hath quite devoured also our money.

031:016 For all the riches which God hath taken from our father, that
        is ours, and our children's: now then, whatsoever God hath
        said unto thee, do.

031:017 Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon
        camels;

031:018 And he carried away all his cattle, and all his goods which he
        had gotten, the cattle of his getting, which he had gotten in
        Padanaram, for to go to Isaac his father in the land of
        Canaan.

031:019 And Laban went to shear his sheep: and Rachel had stolen the
        images that were her father's.

031:020 And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he
        told him not that he fled.

031:021 So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed
        over the river, and set his face toward the mount Gilead.

031:022 And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled.

031:023 And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven
        days' journey; and they overtook him in the mount Gilead.

031:024 And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night, and said
        unto him, Take heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good
        or bad.

031:025 Then Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in
        the mount: and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of
        Gilead.

031:026 And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast
        stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters, as
        captives taken with the sword?

031:027 Wherefore didst thou flee away secretly, and steal away from
        me; and didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee away
        with mirth, and with songs, with tabret, and with harp?

031:028 And hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters?
        thou hast now done foolishly in so doing.

031:029 It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of
        your father spake unto me yesternight, saying, Take thou heed
        that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.

031:030 And now, though thou wouldest needs be gone, because thou sore
        longedst after thy father's house, yet wherefore hast thou
        stolen my gods?

031:031 And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid:
        for I said, Peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy
        daughters from me.

031:032 With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let him not live:
        before our brethren discern thou what is thine with me, and
        take it to thee. For Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen
        them.

031:033 And Laban went into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and
        into the two maidservants' tents; but he found them not. Then
        went he out of Leah's tent, and entered into Rachel's tent.

031:034 Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel's
        furniture, and sat upon them. And Laban searched all the tent,
        but found them not.

031:035 And she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that
        I cannot rise up before thee; for the custom of women is upon
        me. And he searched but found not the images.

031:036 And Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban: and Jacob answered
        and said to Laban, What is my trespass? what is my sin, that
        thou hast so hotly pursued after me?

031:037 Whereas thou hast searched all my stuff, what hast thou found
        of all thy household stuff? set it here before my brethren and
        thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt us both.

031:038 This twenty years have I been with thee; thy ewes and thy she
        goats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flock
        have I not eaten.

031:039 That which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee; I bare
        the loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it, whether
        stolen by day, or stolen by night.

031:040 Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost
        by night; and my sleep departed from mine eyes.

031:041 Thus have I been twenty years in thy house; I served thee
        fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy
        cattle: and thou hast changed my wages ten times.

031:042 Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear
        of Isaac, had been with me, surely thou hadst sent me away now
        empty. God hath seen mine affliction and the labour of my
        hands, and rebuked thee yesternight.

031:043 And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, These daughters are my
        daughters, and these children are my children, and these
        cattle are my cattle, and all that thou seest is mine: and
        what can I do this day unto these my daughters, or unto their
        children which they have born?

031:044 Now therefore come thou, let us make a covenant, I and thou;
        and let it be for a witness between me and thee.

031:045 And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar.

031:046 And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took
        stones, and made an heap: and they did eat there upon the
        heap.

031:047 And Laban called it Jegarsahadutha: but Jacob called it
        Galeed.

031:048 And Laban said, This heap is a witness between me and thee
        this day. Therefore was the name of it called Galeed;

031:049 And Mizpah; for he said, The LORD watch between me and thee,
        when we are absent one from another.

031:050 If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take
        other wives beside my daughters, no man is with us; see, God
        is witness betwixt me and thee.

031:051 And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold this
        pillar, which I have cast betwixt me and thee:

031:052 This heap be witness, and this pillar be witness, that I will
        not pass over this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass
        over this heap and this pillar unto me, for harm.

031:053 The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their
        father, judge betwixt us. And Jacob sware by the fear of his
        father Isaac.

031:054 Then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount, and called his
        brethren to eat bread: and they did eat bread, and tarried all
        night in the mount.

031:055 And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons
        and his daughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed, and
        returned unto his place.

032:001 And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.

032:002 And when Jacob saw them, he said, This is God's host: and he
        called the name of that place Mahanaim.

032:003 And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto
        the land of Seir, the country of Edom.

032:004 And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak unto my
        lord Esau; Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with
        Laban, and stayed there until now:

032:005 And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and menservants, and
        womenservants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may
        find grace in thy sight.

032:006 And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy
        brother Esau, and also he cometh to meet thee, and four
        hundred men with him.

032:007 Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided
        the people that was with him, and the flocks, and herds, and
        the camels, into two bands;

032:008 And said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then
        the other company which is left shall escape.

032:009 And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my
        father Isaac, the LORD which saidst unto me, Return unto thy
        country, and to thy kindred, and I will deal well with thee:

032:010 I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all
        the truth, which thou hast shewed unto thy servant; for with
        my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two
        bands.

032:011 Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the
        hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me,
        and the mother with the children.

032:012 And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed
        as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for
        multitude.

032:013 And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which
        came to his hand a present for Esau his brother;

032:014 Two hundred she goats, and twenty he goats, two hundred ewes,
        and twenty rams,

032:015 Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty kine, and ten
        bulls, twenty she asses, and ten foals.

032:016 And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every
        drove by themselves; and said unto his servants, Pass over
        before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove.

032:017 And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother
        meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose art thou? and
        whither goest thou? and whose are these before thee?

032:018 Then thou shalt say, They be thy servant Jacob's; it is a
        present sent unto my lord Esau: and, behold, also he is behind
        us.

032:019 And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that
        followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak
        unto Esau, when ye find him.

032:020 And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us.
        For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth
        before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he
        will accept of me.

032:021 So went the present over before him: and himself lodged that
        night in the company.

032:022 And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two
        womenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford
        Jabbok.

032:023 And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over
        that he had.

032:024 And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him
        until the breaking of the day.

032:025 And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched
        the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was
        out of joint, as he wrestled with him.

032:026 And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I
        will not let thee go, except thou bless me.

032:027 And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob.

032:028 And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but
        Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men,
        and hast prevailed.

032:029 And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name.
        And he said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name?
        And he blessed him there.

032:030 And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen
        God face to face, and my life is preserved.

032:031 And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he
        halted upon his thigh.

032:032 Therefore the children of Israel eat not of the sinew which
        shrank, which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day:
        because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew
        that shrank.

033:001 And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau
        came, and with him four hundred men. And he divided the
        children unto Leah, and unto Rachel, and unto the two
        handmaids.

033:002 And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah
        and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost.

033:003 And he passed over before them, and bowed himself to the
        ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.

033:004 And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his
        neck, and kissed him: and they wept.

033:005 And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children;
        and said, Who are those with thee? And he said, The children
        which God hath graciously given thy servant.

033:006 Then the handmaidens came near, they and their children, and
        they bowed themselves.

033:007 And Leah also with her children came near, and bowed
        themselves: and after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they
        bowed themselves.

033:008 And he said, What meanest thou by all this drove which I met?
        And he said, These are to find grace in the sight of my lord.

033:009 And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; keep that thou hast
        unto thyself.

033:010 And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found grace in
        thy sight, then receive my present at my hand: for therefore I
        have seen thy face, as though I had seen the face of God, and
        thou wast pleased with me.

033:011 Take, I pray thee, my blessing that is brought to thee;
        because God hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have
        enough. And he urged him, and he took it.

033:012 And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I
        will go before thee.

033:013 And he said unto him, My lord knoweth that the children are
        tender, and the flocks and herds with young are with me: and
        if men should overdrive them one day, all the flock will die.

033:014 Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant: and I
        will lead on softly, according as the cattle that goeth before
        me and the children be able to endure, until I come unto my
        lord unto Seir.

033:015 And Esau said, Let me now leave with thee some of the folk
        that are with me. And he said, What needeth it? let me find
        grace in the sight of my lord.

033:016 So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir.

033:017 And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him an house, and
        made booths for his cattle: therefore the name of the place is
        called Succoth.

033:018 And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which is in the
        land of Canaan, when he came from Padanaram; and pitched his
        tent before the city.

033:019 And he bought a parcel of a field, where he had spread his
        tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem's father,
        for an hundred pieces of money.

033:020 And he erected there an altar, and called it EleloheIsrael.

034:001 And Dinah the daughter of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob,
        went out to see the daughters of the land.

034:002 And when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the
        country, saw her, he took her, and lay with her, and defiled
        her.

034:003 And his soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he
        loved the damsel, and spake kindly unto the damsel.

034:004 And Shechem spake unto his father Hamor, saying, Get me this
        damsel to wife.

034:005 And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter: now
        his sons were with his cattle in the field: and Jacob held his
        peace until they were come.

034:006 And Hamor the father of Shechem went out unto Jacob to commune
        with him.

034:007 And the sons of Jacob came out of the field when they heard
        it: and the men were grieved, and they were very wroth,
        because he had wrought folly in Israel in lying with Jacob's
        daughter: which thing ought not to be done.

034:008 And Hamor communed with them, saying, The soul of my son
        Shechem longeth for your daughter: I pray you give her him to
        wife.

034:009 And make ye marriages with us, and give your daughters unto
        us, and take our daughters unto you.

034:010 And ye shall dwell with us: and the land shall be before you;
        dwell and trade ye therein, and get you possessions therein.

034:011 And Shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren, Let me
        find grace in your eyes, and what ye shall say unto me I will
        give.

034:012 Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I will give according
        as ye shall say unto me: but give me the damsel to wife.

034:013 And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father
        deceitfully, and said, because he had defiled Dinah their
        sister:

034:014 And they said unto them, We cannot do this thing, to give our
        sister to one that is uncircumcised; for that were a reproach
        unto us:

034:015 But in this will we consent unto you: If ye will be as we be,
        that every male of you be circumcised;

034:016 Then will we give our daughters unto you, and we will take
        your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will
        become one people.

034:017 But if ye will not hearken unto us, to be circumcised; then
        will we take our daughter, and we will be gone.

034:018 And their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor's son.

034:019 And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had
        delight in Jacob's daughter: and he was more honourable than
        all the house of his father.

034:020 And Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of their
        city, and communed with the men of their city, saying,

034:021 These men are peaceable with us; therefore let them dwell in
        the land, and trade therein; for the land, behold, it is large
        enough for them; let us take their daughters to us for wives,
        and let us give them our daughters.

034:022 Only herein will the men consent unto us for to dwell with us,
        to be one people, if every male among us be circumcised, as
        they are circumcised.

034:023 Shall not their cattle and their substance and every beast of
        their's be our's? only let us consent unto them, and they will
        dwell with us.

034:024 And unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened all that
        went out of the gate of his city; and every male was
        circumcised, all that went out of the gate of his city.

034:025 And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore,
        that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's
        brethren, took each man his sword, and came upon the city
        boldly, and slew all the males.

034:026 And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the
        sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem's house, and went out.

034:027 The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and spoiled the city,
        because they had defiled their sister.

034:028 They took their sheep, and their oxen, and their asses, and
        that which was in the city, and that which was in the field,

034:029 And all their wealth, and all their little ones, and their
        wives took they captive, and spoiled even all that was in the
        house.

034:030 And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me to make
        me to stink among the inhabitants of the land, among the
        Canaanites and the Perizzites: and I being few in number, they
        shall gather themselves together against me, and slay me; and
        I shall be destroyed, I and my house.

034:031 And they said, Should he deal with our sister as with an
        harlot?

035:001 And God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell
        there: and make there an altar unto God, that appeared unto
        thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother.

035:002 Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were with
        him, Put away the strange gods that are among you, and be
        clean, and change your garments:

035:003 And let us arise, and go up to Bethel; and I will make there
        an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress,
        and was with me in the way which I went.

035:004 And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which were in
        their hand, and all their earrings which were in their ears;
        and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem.

035:005 And they journeyed: and the terror of God was upon the cities
        that were round about them, and they did not pursue after the
        sons of Jacob.

035:006 So Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan, that is,
        Bethel, he and all the people that were with him.

035:007 And he built there an altar, and called the place Elbethel:
        because there God appeared unto him, when he fled from the
        face of his brother.

035:008 But Deborah Rebekah's nurse died, and she was buried beneath
        Bethel under an oak: and the name of it was called
        Allonbachuth.

035:009 And God appeared unto Jacob again, when he came out of
        Padanaram, and blessed him.

035:010 And God said unto him, Thy name is Jacob: thy name shall not
        be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name: and he
        called his name Israel.

035:011 And God said unto him, I am God Almighty: be fruitful and
        multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee,
        and kings shall come out of thy loins;

035:012 And the land which I gave Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will
        give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land.

035:013 And God went up from him in the place where he talked with
        him.

035:014 And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with
        him, even a pillar of stone: and he poured a drink offering
        thereon, and he poured oil thereon.

035:015 And Jacob called the name of the place where God spake with
        him, Bethel.

035:016 And they journeyed from Bethel; and there was but a little way
        to come to Ephrath: and Rachel travailed, and she had hard
        labour.

035:017 And it came to pass, when she was in hard labour, that the
        midwife said unto her, Fear not; thou shalt have this son
        also.

035:018 And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing, (for she
        died) that she called his name Benoni: but his father called
        him Benjamin.

035:019 And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath, which
        is Bethlehem.

035:020 And Jacob set a pillar upon her grave: that is the pillar of
        Rachel's grave unto this day.

035:021 And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of
        Edar.

035:022 And it came to pass, when Israel dwelt in that land, that
        Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine: and
        Israel heard it. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve:

035:023 The sons of Leah; Reuben, Jacob's firstborn, and Simeon, and
        Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun:

035:024 The sons of Rachel; Joseph, and Benjamin:

035:025 And the sons of Bilhah, Rachel's handmaid; Dan, and Naphtali:

035:026 And the sons of Zilpah, Leah's handmaid: Gad, and Asher: these
        are the sons of Jacob, which were born to him in Padanaram.

035:027 And Jacob came unto Isaac his father unto Mamre, unto the city
        of Arbah, which is Hebron, where Abraham and Isaac sojourned.

035:028 And the days of Isaac were an hundred and fourscore years.

035:029 And Isaac gave up the ghost, and died, and was gathered unto
        his people, being old and full of days: and his sons Esau and
        Jacob buried him.

036:001 Now these are the generations of Esau, who is Edom.

036:002 Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan; Adah the
        daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Aholibamah the daughter of
        Anah the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite;

036:003 And Bashemath Ishmael's daughter, sister of Nebajoth.

036:004 And Adah bare to Esau Eliphaz; and Bashemath bare Reuel;

036:005 And Aholibamah bare Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah: these are
        the sons of Esau, which were born unto him in the land of
        Canaan.

036:006 And Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and
        all the persons of his house, and his cattle, and all his
        beasts, and all his substance, which he had got in the land of
        Canaan; and went into the country from the face of his brother
        Jacob.

036:007 For their riches were more than that they might dwell
        together; and the land wherein they were strangers could not
        bear them because of their cattle.

036:008 Thus dwelt Esau in mount Seir: Esau is Edom.

036:009 And these are the generations of Esau the father of the
        Edomites in mount Seir:

036:010 These are the names of Esau's sons; Eliphaz the son of Adah
        the wife of Esau, Reuel the son of Bashemath the wife of Esau.

036:011 And the sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, and Gatam,
        and Kenaz.

036:012 And Timna was concubine to Eliphaz Esau's son; and she bare to
        Eliphaz Amalek: these were the sons of Adah Esau's wife.

036:013 And these are the sons of Reuel; Nahath, and Zerah, Shammah,
        and Mizzah: these were the sons of Bashemath Esau's wife.

036:014 And these were the sons of Aholibamah, the daughter of Anah
        the daughter of Zibeon, Esau's wife: and she bare to Esau
        Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah.

036:015 These were dukes of the sons of Esau: the sons of Eliphaz the
        firstborn son of Esau; duke Teman, duke Omar, duke Zepho, duke
        Kenaz,

036:016 Duke Korah, duke Gatam, and duke Amalek: these are the dukes
        that came of Eliphaz in the land of Edom; these were the sons
        of Adah.

036:017 And these are the sons of Reuel Esau's son; duke Nahath, duke
        Zerah, duke Shammah, duke Mizzah: these are the dukes that
        came of Reuel in the land of Edom; these are the sons of
        Bashemath Esau's wife.

036:018 And these are the sons of Aholibamah Esau's wife; duke Jeush,
        duke Jaalam, duke Korah: these were the dukes that came of
        Aholibamah the daughter of Anah, Esau's wife.

036:019 These are the sons of Esau, who is Edom, and these are their
        dukes.

036:020 These are the sons of Seir the Horite, who inhabited the land;
        Lotan, and Shobal, and Zibeon, and Anah,

036:021 And Dishon, and Ezer, and Dishan: these are the dukes of the
        Horites, the children of Seir in the land of Edom.

036:022 And the children of Lotan were Hori and Hemam; and Lotan's
        sister was Timna.

036:023 And the children of Shobal were these; Alvan, and Manahath,
        and Ebal, Shepho, and Onam.

036:024 And these are the children of Zibeon; both Ajah, and Anah:
        this was that Anah that found the mules in the wilderness, as
        he fed the asses of Zibeon his father.

036:025 And the children of Anah were these; Dishon, and Aholibamah
        the daughter of Anah.

036:026 And these are the children of Dishon; Hemdan, and Eshban, and
        Ithran, and Cheran.

036:027 The children of Ezer are these; Bilhan, and Zaavan, and Akan.

036:028 The children of Dishan are these; Uz, and Aran.

036:029 These are the dukes that came of the Horites; duke Lotan, duke
        Shobal, duke Zibeon, duke Anah,

036:030 Duke Dishon, duke Ezer, duke Dishan: these are the dukes that
        came of Hori, among their dukes in the land of Seir.

036:031 And these are the kings that reigned in the land of Edom,
        before there reigned any king over the children of Israel.

036:032 And Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom: and the name of his
        city was Dinhabah.

036:033 And Bela died, and Jobab the son of Zerah of Bozrah reigned in
        his stead.

036:034 And Jobab died, and Husham of the land of Temani reigned in
        his stead.

036:035 And Husham died, and Hadad the son of Bedad, who smote Midian
        in the field of Moab, reigned in his stead: and the name of
        his city was Avith.

036:036 And Hadad died, and Samlah of Masrekah reigned in his stead.

036:037 And Samlah died, and Saul of Rehoboth by the river reigned in
        his stead.

036:038 And Saul died, and Baalhanan the son of Achbor reigned in his
        stead.

036:039 And Baalhanan the son of Achbor died, and Hadar reigned in his
        stead: and the name of his city was Pau; and his wife's name
        was Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred, the daughter of
        Mezahab.

036:040 And these are the names of the dukes that came of Esau,
        according to their families, after their places, by their
        names; duke Timnah, duke Alvah, duke Jetheth,

036:041 Duke Aholibamah, duke Elah, duke Pinon,

036:042 Duke Kenaz, duke Teman, duke Mibzar,

036:043 Duke Magdiel, duke Iram: these be the dukes of Edom, according
        to their habitations in the land of their possession: he is
        Esau the father of the Edomites.

037:001 And Jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father was a stranger,
        in the land of Canaan.

037:002 These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen
        years old, was feeding the flock with his brethren; and the
        lad was with the sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah,
        his father's wives: and Joseph brought unto his father their
        evil report.

037:003 Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he
        was the son of his old age: and he made him a coat of many
        colours.

037:004 And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more
        than all his brethren, they hated him, and could not speak
        peaceably unto him.

037:005 And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it his brethren: and
        they hated him yet the more.

037:006 And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I
        have dreamed:

037:007 For, behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and, lo, my
        sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your sheaves
        stood round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf.

037:008 And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us?
        or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him
        yet the more for his dreams, and for his words.

037:009 And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brethren,
        and said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold,
        the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to
        me.

037:010 And he told it to his father, and to his brethren: and his
        father rebuked him, and said unto him, What is this dream that
        thou hast dreamed? Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren
        indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth?

037:011 And his brethren envied him; but his father observed the
        saying.

037:012 And his brethren went to feed their father's flock in Shechem.

037:013 And Israel said unto Joseph, Do not thy brethren feed the
        flock in Shechem? come, and I will send thee unto them. And he
        said to him, Here am I.

037:014 And he said to him, Go, I pray thee, see whether it be well
        with thy brethren, and well with the flocks; and bring me word
        again. So he sent him out of the vale of Hebron, and he came
        to Shechem.

037:015 And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering in
        the field: and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou?

037:016 And he said, I seek my brethren: tell me, I pray thee, where
        they feed their flocks.

037:017 And the man said, They are departed hence; for I heard them
        say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brethren,
        and found them in Dothan.

037:018 And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near unto
        them, they conspired against him to slay him.

037:019 And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh.

037:020 Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into
        some pit, and we will say, Some evil beast hath devoured him:
        and we shall see what will become of his dreams.

037:021 And Reuben heard it, and he delivered him out of their hands;
        and said, Let us not kill him.

037:022 And Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood, but cast him into
        this pit that is in the wilderness, and lay no hand upon him;
        that he might rid him out of their hands, to deliver him to
        his father again.

037:023 And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren,
        that they stript Joseph out of his coat, his coat of many
        colours that was on him;

037:024 And they took him, and cast him into a pit: and the pit was
        empty, there was no water in it.

037:025 And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes
        and looked, and, behold, a company of Ishmeelites came from
        Gilead with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh,
        going to carry it down to Egypt.

037:026 And Judah said unto his brethren, What profit is it if we slay
        our brother, and conceal his blood?

037:027 Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmeelites, and let not our
        hand be upon him; for he is our brother and our flesh. And his
        brethren were content.

037:028 Then there passed by Midianites merchantmen; and they drew and
        lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the
        Ishmeelites for twenty pieces of silver: and they brought
        Joseph into Egypt.

037:029 And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph was not
        in the pit; and he rent his clothes.

037:030 And he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child is not;
        and I, whither shall I go?

037:031 And they took Joseph's coat, and killed a kid of the goats,
        and dipped the coat in the blood;

037:032 And they sent the coat of many colours, and they brought it to
        their father; and said, This have we found: know now whether
        it be thy son's coat or no.

037:033 And he knew it, and said, It is my son's coat; an evil beast
        hath devoured him; Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces.

037:034 And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins,
        and mourned for his son many days.

037:035 And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him;
        but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go
        down into the grave unto my son mourning. Thus his father wept
        for him.

037:036 And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an
        officer of Pharaoh's, and captain of the guard.

038:001 And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from
        his brethren, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose
        name was Hirah.

038:002 And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose
        name was Shuah; and he took her, and went in unto her.

038:003 And she conceived, and bare a son; and he called his name Er.

038:004 And she conceived again, and bare a son; and she called his
        name Onan.

038:005 And she yet again conceived, and bare a son; and called his
        name Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bare him.

038:006 And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, whose name was
        Tamar.

038:007 And Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the
        LORD; and the LORD slew him.

038:008 And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother's wife, and
        marry her, and raise up seed to thy brother.

038:009 And Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and it came to
        pass, when he went in unto his brother's wife, that he spilled
        it on the ground, lest that he should give seed to his
        brother.

038:010 And the thing which he did displeased the LORD: wherefore he
        slew him also.

038:011 Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter in law, Remain a widow
        at thy father's house, till Shelah my son be grown: for he
        said, Lest peradventure he die also, as his brethren did. And
        Tamar went and dwelt in her father's house.

038:012 And in process of time the daughter of Shuah Judah's wife
        died; and Judah was comforted, and went up unto his
        sheepshearers to Timnath, he and his friend Hirah the
        Adullamite.

038:013 And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold thy father in law goeth
        up to Timnath to shear his sheep.

038:014 And she put her widow's garments off from her, and covered her
        with a vail, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place,
        which is by the way to Timnath; for she saw that Shelah was
        grown, and she was not given unto him to wife.

038:015 When Judah saw her, he thought her to be an harlot; because
        she had covered her face.

038:016 And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray
        thee, let me come in unto thee; (for he knew not that she was
        his daughter in law.) And she said, What wilt thou give me,
        that thou mayest come in unto me?

038:017 And he said, I will send thee a kid from the flock. And she
        said, Wilt thou give me a pledge, till thou send it?

038:018 And he said, What pledge shall I give thee? And she said, Thy
        signet, and thy bracelets, and thy staff that is in thine
        hand. And he gave it her, and came in unto her, and she
        conceived by him.

038:019 And she arose, and went away, and laid by her vail from her,
        and put on the garments of her widowhood.

038:020 And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the
        Adullamite, to receive his pledge from the woman's hand: but
        he found her not.

038:021 Then he asked the men of that place, saying, Where is the
        harlot, that was openly by the way side? And they said, There
        was no harlot in this place.

038:022 And he returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her; and
        also the men of the place said, that there was no harlot in
        this place.

038:023 And Judah said, Let her take it to her, lest we be shamed:
        behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her.

038:024 And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told
        Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the
        harlot; and also, behold, she is with child by whoredom. And
        Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt.

038:025 When she was brought forth, she sent to her father in law,
        saying, By the man, whose these are, am I with child: and she
        said, Discern, I pray thee, whose are these, the signet, and
        bracelets, and staff.

038:026 And Judah acknowledged them, and said, She hath been more
        righteous than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my
        son. And he knew her again no more.

038:027 And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold,
        twins were in her womb.

038:028 And it came to pass, when she travailed, that the one put out
        his hand: and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a
        scarlet thread, saying, This came out first.

038:029 And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold,
        his brother came out: and she said, How hast thou broken
        forth? this breach be upon thee: therefore his name was called
        Pharez.

038:030 And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet
        thread upon his hand: and his name was called Zarah.

039:001 And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer
        of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of
        the hands of the Ishmeelites, which had brought him down
        thither.

039:002 And the LORD was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and
        he was in the house of his master the Egyptian.

039:003 And his master saw that the LORD was with him, and that the
        LORD made all that he did to prosper in his hand.

039:004 And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him: and he
        made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put
        into his hand.

039:005 And it came to pass from the time that he had made him
        overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that the LORD
        blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake; and the
        blessing of the LORD was upon all that he had in the house,
        and in the field.

039:006 And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand; and he knew not
        ought he had, save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was
        a goodly person, and well favoured.

039:007 And it came to pass after these things, that his master's wife
        cast her eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me.

039:008 But he refused, and said unto his master's wife, Behold, my
        master wotteth not what is with me in the house, and he hath
        committed all that he hath to my hand;

039:009 There is none greater in this house than I; neither hath he
        kept back any thing from me but thee, because thou art his
        wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against
        God?

039:010 And it came to pass, as she spake to Joseph day by day, that
        he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, or to be with her.

039:011 And it came to pass about this time, that Joseph went into the
        house to do his business; and there was none of the men of the
        house there within.

039:012 And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he
        left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out.

039:013 And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment
        in her hand, and was fled forth,

039:014 That she called unto the men of her house, and spake unto
        them, saying, See, he hath brought in an Hebrew unto us to
        mock us; he came in unto me to lie with me, and I cried with a
        loud voice:

039:015 And it came to pass, when he heard that I lifted up my voice
        and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled, and got
        him out.

039:016 And she laid up his garment by her, until his lord came home.

039:017 And she spake unto him according to these words, saying, The
        Hebrew servant, which thou hast brought unto us, came in unto
        me to mock me:

039:018 And it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that
        he left his garment with me, and fled out.

039:019 And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his
        wife, which she spake unto him, saying, After this manner did
        thy servant to me; that his wrath was kindled.

039:020 And Joseph's master took him, and put him into the prison, a
        place where the king's prisoners were bound: and he was there
        in the prison.

039:021 But the LORD was with Joseph, and shewed him mercy, and gave
        him favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison.

039:022 And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all
        the prisoners that were in the prison; and whatsoever they did
        there, he was the doer of it.

039:023 The keeper of the prison looked not to any thing that was
        under his hand; because the LORD was with him, and that which
        he did, the LORD made it to prosper.

040:001 And it came to pass after these things, that the butler of the
        king of Egypt and his baker had offended their lord the king
        of Egypt.

040:002 And Pharaoh was wroth against two of his officers, against the
        chief of the butlers, and against the chief of the bakers.

040:003 And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the
        guard, into the prison, the place where Joseph was bound.

040:004 And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he
        served them: and they continued a season in ward.

040:005 And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream in
        one night, each man according to the interpretation of his
        dream, the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, which
        were bound in the prison.

040:006 And Joseph came in unto them in the morning, and looked upon
        them, and, behold, they were sad.

040:007 And he asked Pharaoh's officers that were with him in the ward
        of his lord's house, saying, Wherefore look ye so sadly to
        day?

040:008 And they said unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and there is
        no interpreter of it. And Joseph said unto them, Do not
        interpretations belong to God? tell me them, I pray you.

040:009 And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to
        him, In my dream, behold, a vine was before me;

040:010 And in the vine were three branches: and it was as though it
        budded, and her blossoms shot forth; and the clusters thereof
        brought forth ripe grapes:

040:011 And Pharaoh's cup was in my hand: and I took the grapes, and
        pressed them into Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup into
        Pharaoh's hand.

040:012 And Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation of it:
        The three branches are three days:

040:013 Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thine head, and
        restore thee unto thy place: and thou shalt deliver Pharaoh's
        cup into his hand, after the former manner when thou wast his
        butler.

040:014 But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and shew
        kindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto
        Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house:

040:015 For indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews:
        and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into
        the dungeon.

040:016 When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he
        said unto Joseph, I also was in my dream, and, behold, I had
        three white baskets on my head:

040:017 And in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of
        bakemeats for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out of the
        basket upon my head.

040:018 And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation
        thereof: The three baskets are three days:

040:019 Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off
        thee, and shall hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat
        thy flesh from off thee.

040:020 And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh's
        birthday, that he made a feast unto all his servants: and he
        lifted up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker
        among his servants.

040:021 And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again;
        and he gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand:

040:022 But he hanged the chief baker: as Joseph had interpreted to
        them.

040:023 Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him.

041:001 And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh
        dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river.

041:002 And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well
        favoured kine and fatfleshed; and they fed in a meadow.

041:003 And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the
        river, ill favoured and leanfleshed; and stood by the other
        kine upon the brink of the river.

041:004 And the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven
        well favoured and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke.

041:005 And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven
        ears of corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good.

041:006 And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind
        sprung up after them.

041:007 And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears.
        And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a dream.

041:008 And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was
        troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of
        Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his
        dream; but there was none that could interpret them unto
        Pharaoh.

041:009 Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do
        remember my faults this day:

041:010 Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in ward in the
        captain of the guard's house, both me and the chief baker:

041:011 And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each
        man according to the interpretation of his dream.

041:012 And there was there with us a young man, an Hebrew, servant to
        the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted
        to us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he did
        interpret.

041:013 And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he
        restored unto mine office, and him he hanged.

041:014 Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him
        hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved himself, and changed
        his raiment, and came in unto Pharaoh.

041:015 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and
        there is none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of
        thee, that thou canst understand a dream to interpret it.

041:016 And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God
        shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace.

041:017 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood
        upon the bank of the river:

041:018 And, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine,
        fatfleshed and well favoured; and they fed in a meadow:

041:019 And, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor and
        very ill favoured and leanfleshed, such as I never saw in all
        the land of Egypt for badness:

041:020 And the lean and the ill favoured kine did eat up the first
        seven fat kine:

041:021 And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that
        they had eaten them; but they were still ill favoured, as at
        the beginning. So I awoke.

041:022 And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one
        stalk, full and good:

041:023 And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, and blasted with the
        east wind, sprung up after them:

041:024 And the thin ears devoured the seven good ears: and I told
        this unto the magicians; but there was none that could declare
        it to me.

041:025 And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one: God
        hath shewed Pharaoh what he is about to do.

041:026 The seven good kine are seven years; and the seven good ears
        are seven years: the dream is one.

041:027 And the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after
        them are seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with
        the east wind shall be seven years of famine.

041:028 This is the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: What God
        is about to do he sheweth unto Pharaoh.

041:029 Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all
        the land of Egypt:

041:030 And there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and
        all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and
        the famine shall consume the land;

041:031 And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of
        that famine following; for it shall be very grievous.

041:032 And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; it is
        because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly
        bring it to pass.

041:033 Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise,
        and set him over the land of Egypt.

041:034 Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint officers over the
        land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the
        seven plenteous years.

041:035 And let them gather all the food of those good years that
        come, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them
        keep food in the cities.

041:036 And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven
        years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the
        land perish not through the famine.

041:037 And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes
        of all his servants.

041:038 And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find such a one as
        this is, a man in whom the Spirit of God is?

041:039 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shewed
        thee all this, there is none so discreet and wise as thou art:

041:040 Thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall
        all my people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater
        than thou.

041:041 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all
        the land of Egypt.

041:042 And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon
        Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and
        put a gold chain about his neck;

041:043 And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had;
        and they cried before him, Bow the knee: and he made him ruler
        over all the land of Egypt.

041:044 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without thee
        shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of
        Egypt.

041:045 And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphnathpaaneah; and he gave
        him to wife Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On.
        And Joseph went out over all the land of Egypt.

041:046 And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh
        king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of
        Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt.

041:047 And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by
        handfuls.

041:048 And he gathered up all the food of the seven years, which were
        in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the
        food of the field, which was round about every city, laid he
        up in the same.

041:049 And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much,
        until he left numbering; for it was without number.

041:050 And unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine
        came, which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On
        bare unto him.

041:051 And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For God,
        said he, hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father's
        house.

041:052 And the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God hath
        caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.

041:053 And the seven years of plenteousness, that was in the land of
        Egypt, were ended.

041:054 And the seven years of dearth began to come, according as
        Joseph had said: and the dearth was in all lands; but in all
        the land of Egypt there was bread.

041:055 And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried
        to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians,
        Go unto Joseph; what he saith to you, do.

041:056 And the famine was over all the face of the earth: and Joseph
        opened all the storehouses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and
        the famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt.

041:057 And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy corn;
        because that the famine was so sore in all lands.

042:001 Now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob said
        unto his sons, Why do ye look one upon another?

042:002 And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is corn in Egypt:
        get you down thither, and buy for us from thence; that we may
        live, and not die.

042:003 And Joseph's ten brethren went down to buy corn in Egypt.

042:004 But Benjamin, Joseph's brother, Jacob sent not with his
        brethren; for he said, Lest peradventure mischief befall him.

042:005 And the sons of Israel came to buy corn among those that came:
        for the famine was in the land of Canaan.

042:006 And Joseph was the governor over the land, and he it was that
        sold to all the people of the land: and Joseph's brethren
        came, and bowed down themselves before him with their faces to
        the earth.

042:007 And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made
        himself strange unto them, and spake roughly unto them; and he
        said unto them, Whence come ye? And they said, From the land
        of Canaan to buy food.

042:008 And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him.

042:009 And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and
        said unto them, Ye are spies; to see the nakedness of the land
        ye are come.

042:010 And they said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy
        servants come.

042:011 We are all one man's sons; we are true men, thy servants are
        no spies.

042:012 And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the
        land ye are come.

042:013 And they said, Thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of
        one man in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest is
        this day with our father, and one is not.

042:014 And Joseph said unto them, That is it that I spake unto you,
        saying, Ye are spies:

042:015 Hereby ye shall be proved: By the life of Pharaoh ye shall not
        go forth hence, except your youngest brother come hither.

042:016 Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall
        be kept in prison, that your words may be proved, whether
        there be any truth in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh
        surely ye are spies.

042:017 And he put them all together into ward three days.

042:018 And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live;
        for I fear God:

042:019 If ye be true men, let one of your brethren be bound in the
        house of your prison: go ye, carry corn for the famine of your
        houses:

042:020 But bring your youngest brother unto me; so shall your words
        be verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so.

042:021 And they said one to another, We are verily guilty concerning
        our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he
        besought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress
        come upon us.

042:022 And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you,
        saying, Do not sin against the child; and ye would not hear?
        therefore, behold, also his blood is required.

042:023 And they knew not that Joseph understood them; for he spake
        unto them by an interpreter.

042:024 And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and returned
        to them again, and communed with them, and took from them
        Simeon, and bound him before their eyes.

042:025 Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn, and to
        restore every man's money into his sack, and to give them
        provision for the way: and thus did he unto them.

042:026 And they laded their asses with the corn, and departed thence.

042:027 And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender
        in the inn, he espied his money; for, behold, it was in his
        sack's mouth.

042:028 And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo,
        it is even in my sack: and their heart failed them, and they
        were afraid, saying one to another, What is this that God hath
        done unto us?

042:029 And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan,
        and told him all that befell unto them; saying,

042:030 The man, who is the lord of the land, spake roughly to us, and
        took us for spies of the country.

042:031 And we said unto him, We are true men; we are no spies:

042:032 We be twelve brethren, sons of our father; one is not, and the
        youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan.

042:033 And the man, the lord of the country, said unto us, Hereby
        shall I know that ye are true men; leave one of your brethren
        here with me, and take food for the famine of your households,
        and be gone:

042:034 And bring your youngest brother unto me: then shall I know
        that ye are no spies, but that ye are true men: so will I
        deliver you your brother, and ye shall traffick in the land.

042:035 And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold,
        every man's bundle of money was in his sack: and when both
        they and their father saw the bundles of money, they were
        afraid.

042:036 And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved of
        my children: Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will
        take Benjamin away: all these things are against me.

042:037 And Reuben spake unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if
        I bring him not to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will
        bring him to thee again.

042:038 And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his
        brother is dead, and he is left alone: if mischief befall him
        by the way in the which ye go, then shall ye bring down my
        gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.

043:001 And the famine was sore in the land.

043:002 And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the corn which
        they had brought out of Egypt, their father said unto them, Go
        again, buy us a little food.

043:003 And Judah spake unto him, saying, The man did solemnly protest
        unto us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother
        be with you.

043:004 If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy
        thee food:

043:005 But if thou wilt not send him, we will not go down: for the
        man said unto us, Ye shall not see my face, except your
        brother be with you.

043:006 And Israel said, Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me, as to tell
        the man whether ye had yet a brother?

043:007 And they said, The man asked us straitly of our state, and of
        our kindred, saying, Is your father yet alive? have ye another
        brother? and we told him according to the tenor of these
        words: could we certainly know that he would say, Bring your
        brother down?

043:008 And Judah said unto Israel his father, Send the lad with me,
        and we will arise and go; that we may live, and not die, both
        we, and thou, and also our little ones.

043:009 I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him:
        if I bring him not unto thee, and set him before thee, then
        let me bear the blame for ever:

043:010 For except we had lingered, surely now we had returned this
        second time.

043:011 And their father Israel said unto them, If it must be so now,
        do this; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels,
        and carry down the man a present, a little balm, and a little
        honey, spices, and myrrh, nuts, and almonds:

043:012 And take double money in your hand; and the money that was
        brought again in the mouth of your sacks, carry it again in
        your hand; peradventure it was an oversight:

043:013 Take also your brother, and arise, go again unto the man:

043:014 And God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may
        send away your other brother, and Benjamin. If I be bereaved
        of my children, I am bereaved.

043:015 And the men took that present, and they took double money in
        their hand and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt,
        and stood before Joseph.

043:016 And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler
        of his house, Bring these men home, and slay, and make ready;
        for these men shall dine with me at noon.

043:017 And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men
        into Joseph's house.

043:018 And the men were afraid, because they were brought into
        Joseph's house; and they said, Because of the money that was
        returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in;
        that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and
        take us for bondmen, and our asses.

043:019 And they came near to the steward of Joseph's house, and they
        communed with him at the door of the house,

043:020 And said, O sir, we came indeed down at the first time to buy
        food:

043:021 And it came to pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened
        our sacks, and, behold, every man's money was in the mouth of
        his sack, our money in full weight: and we have brought it
        again in our hand.

043:022 And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food:
        we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks.

043:023 And he said, Peace be to you, fear not: your God, and the God
        of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: I had
        your money. And he brought Simeon out unto them.

043:024 And the man brought the men into Joseph's house, and gave them
        water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses
        provender.

043:025 And they made ready the present against Joseph came at noon:
        for they heard that they should eat bread there.

043:026 And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which
        was in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him
        to the earth.

043:027 And he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your father
        well, the old man of whom ye spake? Is he yet alive?

043:028 And they answered, Thy servant our father is in good health,
        he is yet alive. And they bowed down their heads, and made
        obeisance.

043:029 And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his
        mother's son, and said, Is this your younger brother, of whom
        ye spake unto me? And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my
        son.

043:030 And Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn upon his
        brother: and he sought where to weep; and he entered into his
        chamber, and wept there.

043:031 And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself,
        and said, Set on bread.

043:032 And they set on for him by himself, and for them by
        themselves, and for the Egyptians, which did eat with him, by
        themselves: because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the
        Hebrews; for that is an abomination unto the Egyptians.

043:033 And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his
        birthright, and the youngest according to his youth: and the
        men marvelled one at another.

043:034 And he took and sent messes unto them from before him: but
        Benjamin's mess was five times so much as any of their's. And
        they drank, and were merry with him.

044:001 And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the
        men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put
        every man's money in his sack's mouth.

044:002 And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of the
        youngest, and his corn money. And he did according to the word
        that Joseph had spoken.

044:003 As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they
        and their asses.

044:004 And when they were gone out of the city, and not yet far off,
        Joseph said unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and
        when thou dost overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye
        rewarded evil for good?

044:005 Is not this it in which my lord drinketh, and whereby indeed
        he divineth? ye have done evil in so doing.

044:006 And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these same words.

044:007 And they said unto him, Wherefore saith my lord these words?
        God forbid that thy servants should do according to this
        thing:

044:008 Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we
        brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then
        should we steal out of thy lord's house silver or gold?

044:009 With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, both let him die,
        and we also will be my lord's bondmen.

044:010 And he said, Now also let it be according unto your words: he
        with whom it is found shall be my servant; and ye shall be
        blameless.

044:011 Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground,
        and opened every man his sack.

044:012 And he searched, and began at the eldest, and left at the
        youngest: and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack.

044:013 Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and
        returned to the city.

044:014 And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house; for he was
        yet there: and they fell before him on the ground.

044:015 And Joseph said unto them, What deed is this that ye have
        done? wot ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine?

044:016 And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we
        speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the
        iniquity of thy servants: behold, we are my lord's servants,
        both we, and he also with whom the cup is found.

044:017 And he said, God forbid that I should do so: but the man in
        whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant; and as
        for you, get you up in peace unto your father.

044:018 Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy
        servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let
        not thine anger burn against thy servant: for thou art even as
        Pharaoh.

044:019 My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a
        brother?

044:020 And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a
        child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead,
        and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him.

044:021 And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me,
        that I may set mine eyes upon him.

044:022 And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for
        if he should leave his father, his father would die.

044:023 And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest
        brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more.

044:024 And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my
        father, we told him the words of my lord.

044:025 And our father said, Go again, and buy us a little food.

044:026 And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be
        with us, then will we go down: for we may not see the man's
        face, except our youngest brother be with us.

044:027 And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife
        bare me two sons:

044:028 And the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in
        pieces; and I saw him not since:

044:029 And if ye take this also from me, and mischief befall him, ye
        shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.

044:030 Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the
        lad be not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the
        lad's life;

044:031 It shall come to pass, when he seeth that the lad is not with
        us, that he will die: and thy servants shall bring down the
        gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave.

044:032 For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father,
        saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then I shall bear the
        blame to my father for ever.

044:033 Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of
        the lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his
        brethren.

044:034 For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad be not with
        me? lest peradventure I see the evil that shall come on my
        father.

045:001 Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that
        stood by him; and he cried, Cause every man to go out from me.
        And there stood no man with him, while Joseph made himself
        known unto his brethren.

045:002 And he wept aloud: and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh
        heard.

045:003 And Joseph said unto his brethren, I am Joseph; doth my father
        yet live? And his brethren could not answer him; for they were
        troubled at his presence.

045:004 And Joseph said unto his brethren, Come near to me, I pray
        you. And they came near. And he said, I am Joseph your
        brother, whom ye sold into Egypt.

045:005 Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that
        ye sold me hither: for God did send me before you to preserve
        life.

045:006 For these two years hath the famine been in the land: and yet
        there are five years, in the which there shall neither be
        earing nor harvest.

045:007 And God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the
        earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance.

045:008 So now it was not you that sent me hither, but God: and he
        hath made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house,
        and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt.

045:009 Haste ye, and go up to my father, and say unto him, Thus saith
        thy son Joseph, God hath made me lord of all Egypt: come down
        unto me, tarry not:

045:010 And thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen, and thou shalt be
        near unto me, thou, and thy children, and thy children's
        children, and thy flocks, and thy herds, and all that thou
        hast:

045:011 And there will I nourish thee; for yet there are five years of
        famine; lest thou, and thy household, and all that thou hast,
        come to poverty.

045:012 And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother
        Benjamin, that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you.

045:013 And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of
        all that ye have seen; and ye shall haste and bring down my
        father hither.

045:014 And he fell upon his brother Benjamin's neck, and wept; and
        Benjamin wept upon his neck.

045:015 Moreover he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them: and
        after that his brethren talked with him.

045:016 And the fame thereof was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying,
        Joseph's brethren are come: and it pleased Pharaoh well, and
        his servants.

045:017 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Say unto thy brethren, This do
        ye; lade your beasts, and go, get you unto the land of Canaan;

045:018 And take your father and your households, and come unto me:
        and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye
        shall eat the fat of the land.

045:019 Now thou art commanded, this do ye; take you wagons out of the
        land of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and
        bring your father, and come.

045:020 Also regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land of
        Egypt is your's.

045:021 And the children of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them
        wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them
        provision for the way.

045:022 To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment; but to
        Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver, and five
        changes of raiment.

045:023 And to his father he sent after this manner; ten asses laden
        with the good things of Egypt, and ten she asses laden with
        corn and bread and meat for his father by the way.

045:024 So he sent his brethren away, and they departed: and he said
        unto them, See that ye fall not out by the way.

045:025 And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of
        Canaan unto Jacob their father,

045:026 And told him, saying, Joseph is yet alive, and he is governor
        over all the land of Egypt. And Jacob's heart fainted, for he
        believed them not.

045:027 And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said
        unto them: and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to
        carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived:

045:028 And Israel said, It is enough; Joseph my son is yet alive: I
        will go and see him before I die.

046:001 And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to
        Beersheba, and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father
        Isaac.

046:002 And God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night, and
        said, Jacob, Jacob. And he said, Here am I.

046:003 And he said, I am God, the God of thy father: fear not to go
        down into Egypt; for I will there make of thee a great nation:

046:004 I will go down with thee into Egypt; and I will also surely
        bring thee up again: and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine
        eyes.

046:005 And Jacob rose up from Beersheba: and the sons of Israel
        carried Jacob their father, and their little ones, and their
        wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him.
